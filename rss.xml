            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Does the Lightning Network Threaten Bitcoin's Censorship Resistance?</h1><p>The Lightning Network may well be Bitcoin's primary solution to the issue of scalability , but many skeptics believe there are unresolved issues with this layer-2 system for the blockchain. The possibility of too much centralization via so-called "supernodes" is one of the common criticisms of the Lightning Network, and attached to that is the fear of these new, mostly -centralized payment hubs having the capacity to censor transactions.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a79a74d4acc4a7bdb0e1a5209eb6971e91d29446.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Hi, I just want to introduce my Openbazaar store here just once. I believe I offer an interesting service. * /r/Bitcoin</h1><p>Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/03bb1b5a93fc0720701b7f7e37541340963fd151.png"></article>]]></description>
