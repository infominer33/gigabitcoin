            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ethereum Classic: Ethereum's New Ethereum Explained - CoinDesk</h1><p>What started as an attempt to rescue investor funds in a high-profile project has resulted in a schism that has effectively split the community on the second-largest public blockchain. The split is not only psychological. Thanks to the design of public blockchain systems, it is also technical, with competing visions manifesting in two very real blockchains, or versions of the project's transaction history.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/9dd08b57fcaa0fad00a9e09d76dec5c3/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.coindesk.com%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F07%2Fbaby-babies-e1469725254895.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>On Relay: How Different Bitcoin Developers Are Speeding Up the Network (Part 1)</h1><p>Bitcoin is designed as a peer-to-peer network, where nodes randomly connect to other nodes. Transactions and blocks are transmitted over this network by these nodes, until each has received all. This works quite well, as the distributed model makes Bitcoin relatively censorship-resistant; there is no central point of control to shut down or pressure into compliance.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/917001873ba54662878e7942e25d46ee/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Ffs.bitcoinmagazine.com%2Fimg%2Farticles%2Fon-relay-how-different-bitcoin-developers-are-speeding-up-the-network-part.jpg"></article>]]></description>
