            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Remember: they cannot break bitcoin the tech. They can only try to break bitcoin the community. Pay attention to what comes out of this new "he's Satoshi!!!" thing. "Divide et impera" * /r/Bitcoin</h1><p>Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/03bb1b5a93fc0720701b7f7e37541340963fd151.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How Craig Wright Privately 'Proved' He's Bitcoin's Creator</h1><p>When rumors surfaced early last month that Australian cryptographer Craig Wright would attempt to prove that he created Bitcoin, Gavin Andresen remained skeptical. And as the chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation, his opinion counts: Andresen is among the earliest programmers for the cryptocurrency, and likely the one who has corresponded more than anyone with Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin's pseudonymous, long-lost inventor.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ac748cb28a4faf04e8b9243bc0ca280e5b08db90.jpg"></article>]]></description>
