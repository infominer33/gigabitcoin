            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>I've developed an algorithm that trades Bitcoin. I want to start a fund. What should I do next?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 3): Starting with 1-2 bitcoin, trade your algo quietly for a year. If it shows amazing performance then put more of your own money in and continue. If it shows mediocre performance, try raise a fund. That's what the pros do.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/625b588d429b8b111707443b86d96fbb/noop.jpeg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fqph.ec.quoracdn.net%2Fmain-custom-t-6815-600x315-yxkfgzsliamduhcujtnggvbowygdsmtj.jpeg"></article>]]></description>
