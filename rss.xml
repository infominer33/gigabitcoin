            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin hits a 2-year high thanks to a big change in the code...and China</h1><p>The price of bitcoin has hit its highest level in more than two years due to a change in the cryptocurrency's code which could tighten its supply and as it becomes a safe-haven bet amid broader macroeconomic worries. Bitcoin was trading around $695.32 on Monday, the highest since February 2014.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/1ec530536437c3607db21c8c3401453d3357fe00.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Mining giant BTCC talks about Bitcoin price pop</h1><p>The fact that Bitcoin is undervalued is probably not news to many people involved in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Bitcoin's recent price increase, through the $500 resistance point, rallied over the weekend and is now about to cross $700 (£493, €621). The most immediate price driver is the halving of the number of Bitcoins being mined.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f7e70b28eb83052a8aa55a20d1ae60f0cea05bd0.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is bitcoin mining still profitable in June 2016?</h1><p>First, none of the people mentioned in the question are really on any "wing". Second, a lot of people from all over the political map have misidentified Clinton's positions. This also happened in 2008 against Obama. When I pointed out that she and Obama had nearly identical positions, both sides yelled at me.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>
