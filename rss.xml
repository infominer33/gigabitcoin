Some kind folks donated BTC to us (we were just curious to try), but now we need some advice (being in the bush) on how to use them.. * /r/Bitcoin</h1><p>Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0620d51fcf7b4bce9e2203d3ba6f9417bb14342a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How will Bitcoin block chains be updated and maintained once mining becomes unprofitable?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 2): This is a multiple factor issue, truth be told. Miners receive compensation in two forms: block reward and transaction fees. As the block reward reduces, ultimately fees are supposed to take over to support the miners and their work. But it very well could be that one day there a...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>
