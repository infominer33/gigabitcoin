            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Windows Binary of the ccMiner 1.7.6-r5 fork With Faster Lyra2REv2</h1><p>Here comes a new ccMiner 1.7.6-r5 fork from Nanashi Meiyo-Meijin ( source) based on tpruvot's fork of ccMiner, but with even faster Lyra2REv2 performance. The ccMiner 1.5.80-git SP Nicehash fork from yesterday with improved Lyra2REv2 hashrate was apparently based on the code from the same author, but the Windows binary we have compiled from the ccMiner 1.7.6-r5 source seems to be slightly more optimized and thus is a bit faster.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5abb7f18f917b3a7fb5b443879c3847e5593dda4.jpg"></article>]]></description>
