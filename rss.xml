            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ethereum Soft Fork Under Threat of DDoS Attacks</h1><p>The situation around the attempts to bring back the lost assets of The DAO is gradually gaining farcical shades. This time, the soft fork proposed by Ethereum developers may never occur because yet another vulnerability has been discovered. The soft fork in question is aimed at blocking target DAO address, so that the organization will not be able to effect any transactions.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/43daf90e538c441136936c6a1a20e907/noop.png?input=http%3A%2F%2Fforklog.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2F13.png"></article>]]></description>

But the support team's Facebook page seems to tell a different story. They claim a hacker collective by the name of "Prabl0Dynamic HK" hacked the site. The domain is still down, and the company has started refunding investments from June 26 onwards.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/21df7950ccb19da100c08f5fe3b2576e/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fthemerkle.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2FHashOcean-1.jpg"></article>]]></description>
