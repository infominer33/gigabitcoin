            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>BTCC and HaoBTC Dismiss Rumors of Hard Fork Threat by Chinese Bitcoin Miners</h1><p>Late last week, a post on Chinese Bitcoin community website 8btc gained a lot of attention in certain English-language Bitcoin circles, particularly the subreddit /r/btc.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Coinbase Shuts Down Support For Canadian Customers Come August 1</h1><p>Interesting things are happening to the Coinbase exchange, albeit Canadian users will not be in favor of this news. As it turns out, the company's Canadian payment provider Vogogo will shut down its services. That also means Coinbase will no longer support EFT and Interact transfers.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/29d968469199e685b30a638485929f07/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fthemerkle.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F04%2Fshutterstock_177978593-211x150.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How can blockchain be used as a database to store data?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 4): Blockchains, by design and definition, defines a specific type of database... they are a write once read only database.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is there a lot of innovative blockchain activity in Russia?</h1><p>Answer: Cryptocurrencies are currently illegal in Russia, so I would assume there is very little. Though with that said, its only blockchains of the public form that are illegal, so there very well might be a lot of innovation in the private blockchain industry, but i doubt it.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f557cc6fb54fd6464415c28e49775bc4f78a527b.png"></article>]]></description>
