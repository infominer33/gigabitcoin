            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Blokchalin.info trying to steal Blockchain.info user funds (Google Ads Phishing Attack). * /r/Bitcoin</h1><p>Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin Price Analysis - How to cash in on the upcoming price action</h1><p>The technical setups posted below use simple trend detection, support and resistance, channels, pattern and candle analysis.
