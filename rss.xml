Take American cars from the 1980's and 90's. In his movies, " Roger and Me," filmmaker Roger Moore chronicles the self-destruction of American automaker's market share due, in part, to the vehicles they produced only being designed to last 4-5 years before needing replacement, due to parts designed not to last.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0459b96b940fe53c9fdfe4a0a4e363eee1b6e240.jpg"></article>]]></description>
