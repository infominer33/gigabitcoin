            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What will be the Bitcoin exchange rate in ten years?</h1><p>Answer: Since there are only 3 transactions per second on the Bitcoin blockchain, and since Bitcoins are volatile (which discourages long term holdings), when demand for Bitcoin increases for whatever reason, there is a limit on the number Bitcoins bought per second. This limit on aggregate deman...</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/cd474c39b6a3668a6d6b037b6b291dca/noop.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fqsf.ec.quoracdn.net%2F-images.new_grid.fb_share_default.pnge6dde9cfa6e03c43.png"></article>]]></description>

Bitcoin wallets have no physical presence, and they do not require expensive assistance to create and maintain.

Being a president doesn't = "snarky one line flinging machine." Note: I'm not going to vote for Rubio unless the Democrats nominate a Mugabe/Hitler ticket. (And who has that kind of money anymore?

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin Crashes Again-Is Brexit to Blame?</h1><p>What can you say? Bitcoin's going to be bitcoin. The world's best known crypto-currency has on been an incredible tear for months, reaching a two-year high of $774 per unit on June 18.
