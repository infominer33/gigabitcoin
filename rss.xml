            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Are bitcoin faucets profitable or just a waste of time?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 4): Profitable? You get bitcoin for little to no work. So yes I would consider them profitable. Depends on how much your time is worth. That's relative. It's much more profitable for the owner of the faucet. So I'd argue it's better to create a faucet then use them.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>
