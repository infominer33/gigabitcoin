            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin Price Analysis - How to cash in on the upcoming price action</h1><p>The technical setups posted below use simple trend detection, support and resistance, channels, pattern and candle analysis. We aim for high-probability trade setups on BTCUSD and use very few indicators. All charts use BNC's Bitcoin Liquid Index for maximum accuracy. The timeframe for trades is 1 to 7 days, so we'll use 4h candlesticks.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/bbc17b481ce7dd155d75a9d31077bdb0a57a7716.jpg"></article>]]></description>
