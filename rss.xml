            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Even if the benefit of private blockchain is security, can one query the blockchain faster than a traditional database?</h1><p>Yes, and no. Hypothetically, your telescope will do what you want it to do: see the Earth as it was a million years ago. One million years ago would put the Earth at the Pleistocene epoch, so your continents are already in place and dinosaurs have been dead for 65 million years.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/cd474c39b6a3668a6d6b037b6b291dca/noop.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fqsf.ec.quoracdn.net%2F-images.new_grid.fb_share_default.pnge6dde9cfa6e03c43.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>NRI Report: Japan's New Payment Rules Hold Back Bitcoin Remittances - CoinDesk</h1><p>A forthcoming report from Nomura Research Institute (NRI) argues that despite new regulations aimed at bitcoin and digital currencies, more needs to be done to bring clarity to the innovators working with the technology in Japan. Penned by senior consultant Yasutake Okano, the report centers on the Payment Services Act (PSA), a bill passed by Japan's legislature in May.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a258b11c01e5dc3406ae16621deddc4a/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=1000&cropwidth=1500&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.coindesk.com%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F07%2Fdiet-japan-e1468434867591.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>

To be fair, the signboard is not trying to describe the weather itself. It is an advertisement for a white spirit company. But the irony about the haze situation resonates deeply in Chinese residents and hence this photo went viral on various Chinese social media platforms last week.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f557cc6fb54fd6464415c28e49775bc4f78a527b.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Russian Political Party to Accept Bitcoin Donations - CoinDesk</h1><p>Reports from Russia indicate a minor political party is moving to accept bitcoin donations. The Party of Growth, a center-right party formed in 2009 under the name Just Cause, is reportedly looking to begin accepting donations in the digital currency. The move is notable given the Russian government's complicated and long-controversial stance on digital currencies like bitcoin.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/83884408424f64713b89a671488a9fc1/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.coindesk.com%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F07%2FTitov.jpg"></article>]]></description>
