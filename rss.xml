            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Gold Futures and Bitcoin Price Are Skyrocketing</h1><p>Gold futures and Bitcoin are on similar paths, albeit both for different reasons.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin Price Analysis (Week of June 5th)</h1><p>Bitcoin's price is continuing its upward trend. This confident growth could be persistent on the long-term scale. Will the price reach $600? The upward structure remained intact, as there was no turn at the key resistance line of $512.7. That has caused a new upward surge.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/320fe48446d9bd39d72c1c89603886223583ed5c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Where can I buy Cryptolabs' Case cold bitcoin wallet?</h1><p>I support Donald Trump. American politics is boring. The democrats and GOP have settled into a stalemate that will take decades or a disaster to unravel. No one cares about Rand Paul, although he has the right ideas. So Trump. Thinking of him as a wrecking crane, a catalyst of change.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What factors will determine the value of ether and ethereum?</h1><p>Answer: Like Bitcoin, the fiat "value" of ETH is determined by those who buy and sell it alone. The currency is used to pay for smart contracts within the Ethereum network, so one might say that Ether tokens are "backed" by the value that these smart contracts provide.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>
