            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Can Bitcoin coexist with Ethereum or are they purely competitive?</h1><p>There is no reason why Bitcoin and Ethereum cannot peacefully coexist. There are more than 600 cryptocurrencies in use today, each with slightly different features and properties.
