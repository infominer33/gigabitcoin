            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>$13 million in confiscated bitcoin to be auctioned by Australian police</h1><p>If you want to get in on the Bitcoin action (and have the bank to back you up), now's a good opportunity. The Australian police will be auctioning 24,518 bitcoins seized as the proceeds of a crime. The exchange rate at the time of writing sees one bitcoin equal $534.18 -- so that's over $13 million worth of the digital cryptocurrency.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c28fa33dc605a76dd663e12fb53dae6a8e2549d0.jpg"></article>]]></description>

You see, Chinese regulators have been trying to stop money from leaving the country and it led to a massive increase in demand for bitcoins... Bitcoin prices surged over the long weekend, jumping 15% to $530.00.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5cc91e9311a73ab244ef199a90b8975de8c8429a.jpg"></article>]]></description>
