            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Japan: The Newest Bitcoin Price Influencer? - Bitcoinist.net</h1><p>The price of bitcoin has reached a steady point.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How Falcon, FIBRE and the Fast Relay Network Speed Up Bitcoin Block Propagation (Part 2)</h1><p>Bitcoin is designed as a peer-to-peer network, where nodes randomly connect to other nodes. Transactions and blocks are transmitted over this network by these nodes, until each has received all. This works quite well, as the distributed model makes Bitcoin relatively censorship-resistant; there is no central point of control to shut down or pressure into compliance.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/bb689022602467bde87add6309ca368e/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Ffs.bitcoinmagazine.com%2Fimg%2Farticles%2Fhow-falcon-fibre-and-the-fast-relay-network-speed-up-bitcoin-block-propagation-part.jpg"></article>]]></description>
