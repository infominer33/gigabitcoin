            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How Online Gambling has Embraced Crypto Currency and Why - NEWSBTC</h1><p>Unlike several years ago, when online casinos were too afraid to embrace Bitcoin as a currency for a number of reasons - be it the fear of attacks, instability, or its negative association with criminal collectives, the cryptocurrency is nowadays freely accepted in many online casinos like these, some of which even exclusively offer Bitcoins for their withdrawals and payments.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4a29fb30e8b7297f99d54d60fe9a86cc/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fmain-newsbtc-images%2F2016%2F08%2F29104151%2F7460318592_fc325bb3a9_o.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Introducing Shufflepuff: An Interview with Daniel Krawisz</h1><p>Bitcoin.com recently got together with Bitcoin developer Daniel Krawisz to discuss his new creation Shufflepuff - a coin tumbling tool, which tested its first transaction on August 15. But while Krawisz, a well-known writer and founder of the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute, is a strong proponent of cryptocurrency privacy, he would never support Altcoins such as Dash, or Monero as he believes all altcoins are basically snake oil.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/8a42f7bdc168470fcadda10cd1c9d4fe/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.bitcoin.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2FIntroducing-Shufflepuff-an-Interview-With-Daniel-Krawisz.jpg"></article>]]></description>

The cyber theft -- the second largest by an exchange since hackers took roughly $350 million in bitcoins at Tokyo's MtGox exchange in early 2014 -- is hardly a rare occurrence in the emerging world of crypto-currencies.</p></article>]]></description>
