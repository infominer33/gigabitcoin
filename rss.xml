            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin Price Analysis: 5/25/2016</h1><p>Bitcoin's price is moving along at least a medium-term upward wave. That short movement has a chance of growing into a long-term upward trend. The structure of the upward trend remains intact, and the movement has a potential for further growth as a consequence.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/02c764e728771e99c3085803e35e436a5677ebee.jpg"></article>]]></description>
