            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Ethereum Hardfork Advances Blockchain Governance and Technology</h1><p>The fundamental assumption of any blockchain, whether public or private, is that 51% of actors are honest.

To place weight on their influence is difficult due to the balance of power between these four fundamental pillars.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e0d0012540ea7b4553392d152c426cfa/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cryptocoinsnews.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F07%2FTech-governance.jpg"></article>]]></description>
