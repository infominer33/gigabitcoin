            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin Prices Calm Despite Craig Wright Controversy - CoinDesk</h1><p>Bitcoin has had a quiet week, experiencing low trading volume and rather modest price changes as market observers saw Australian academic Craig Wright claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin. On the other hand, ether - the native token of the Ethereum network - fluctuated far more significantly in terms of price during the seven days through 6th May.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/36bf841e08aa6b14c92552749d3c70746a7e792b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Would this scheme allow faster verification of transactions? (Multiple parallel block chains)</h1><p>One issue with one block chain is that it needs to be globally synchronized. One way to elevate this would be to use multiblock chains. Namely, we can imagine that there are N block chains, working in parallel. To make double spending impossible, a you can only spend a total of 1/N of your total money on each chain.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ef96063d625a5ef5599ed70be4b5dfc791e440fa.png"></article>]]></description>

On MoneyBeat's Friday Food Fight podcast, we talked about "noise" in the market, and how best to handle it.
