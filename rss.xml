            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>North Carolina Bitcoin Legislation Is Decent But Not Perfect</h1><p>It is important to note this Bitcoin legislation is not all negative, though. Chamber of Digital Commerce president Perianne Boring is a public supporter of this new law. Bitcoin and regulation are two topics that will hardly ever go hand-in-hand these days. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory has been signing a lot of legislative proposals as of late.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ece5814174653f366fae416a55d4b167/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fmain-newsbtc-images%2F2016%2F07%2F07093636%2Fshutterstock_77245495.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What are some good podcasts on blockchain and Bitcoin?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 3): I must say I am a bit (pun intended) biased towards Epicenter Bitcoin.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What is bitcoin and how it can be earned?</h1><p>Cutest? Tough call. I don't do "cute." Maybe it's because I'm in high school.
