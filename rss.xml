            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Are Ether Ethereum) paper wallets safe from being backdoored or hacked?</h1><p>Plenty of arrogant jerks are successful. Although everyone he knows essentially says he's a slimy asshole, they also say that he's incredibly smart. One of his professors at Harvard Law said of him "Cruz was off-the-charts brilliant." There's no way in hell I want him as a president, but he definitely knows what he's doing.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What are the biggest opportunities in blockchain that are yet to be developed?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 2): One thing that is noticeably lacking in the Bitcoin world is a company that processes credit card payments and then pays businesses in bitcoin.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Are bitcoin faucets profitable or just a waste of time?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 4): Profitable? You get bitcoin for little to no work. So yes I would consider them profitable. Depends on how much your time is worth. That's relative. It's much more profitable for the owner of the faucet. So I'd argue it's better to create a faucet then use them.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin: How common are bitcoin scams?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 5): Wherever and whenever there is something that has value, someone else will try and take it from you. This is not a flaw in bitcoin, but human nature. I do, however, think that this speaks to the viability of bitcoin in general. That being, bitcoin has value.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[What is bitcoin kernel?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What is bitcoin kernel?</h1><p>Answer: As far as I know there is no such thing as a bitcoin kernel. SHA 256 is an algorithm. SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) is a cryptographic hash function. 256 denotes that it is 256 bits, or 32 bytes, in length. Hash means that it is a one way function.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why will bitcoin work? It seems to me that owners hoard rather than spend. Why would this change?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 5): Bitcoin probably won't work. It was never intended to be a major currency - it's a test for reaching consensus without any trusted third party. A very successful test at that. Bitcoin's success is a problem because the code was not meant for the purpose, and it is not easy to a...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>
