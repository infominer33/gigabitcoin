            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why will bitcoin work? It seems to me that owners hoard rather than spend. Why would this change?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 5): Bitcoin probably won't work. It was never intended to be a major currency - it's a test for reaching consensus without any trusted third party. A very successful test at that. Bitcoin's success is a problem because the code was not meant for the purpose, and it is not easy to a...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is it worth it to mine Bitcoin if I have no power costs?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 6): I think your best bet would be to invest in a nice GPU card and mine an altcoin. Then you can exchange the altcoins for bitcoins. Here is a website where you can compare the profitability of various alternative currencies. Cryptocurrency Mining vs. Bitcoin Mining Profitability ...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin Price Analysis - A quiet week comes to an end</h1><p>The technical setups posted below use simple trend detection, support and resistance, channels, pattern and candle analysis. We aim for high-probability trade setups on BTCUSD and use very few indicators. All charts use BNC's Bitcoin Liquid Index for maximum accuracy. The timeframe for trades is 1 to 7 days, so we'll use 4h candlesticks.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/152c0321728bf0ec145f9c4e1b666e0606a7cc2b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why most bitcoin mining farms are hidden or not publicly shown?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 3): From my experience, most legitimate cloud mining operations would be more than happy to share photos of their "mines". Cloud mining and bitcoin mining are some of the most googled phrases around Bitcoin. This is due to the hype around them. It is getting more difficult to trust ...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>I want to instantly buy bitcoin in the next 10 minutes, where is the best place to do that on the internet?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 4): Probably the website Bitcoin Ranger. It has developed a solid reputation for being the "convenience store of bitcoin". It's also one of the few places where you can buy bitcoin with Paypal. Because buying bitcoins with Paypal or credit card should be easy! ~~</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What sort of math problems are involved in mining bitcoin?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 3): Bitcoin mining is guessing, over and over, a value that gets added to the header of the block you are trying to mine. Each time, once you fill in your guess, the header is put through the SHA-256 hash function twice.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>
