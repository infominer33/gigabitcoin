            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>IRC meeting summary for 2016-06-30</h1><p>A number of people are testing segwit + [BIP 152][] on testnet. There's no PR for this yet as this allows for testing interactions with non-segwit-BIP152 and it needs some BIP changes (in BIP144, [BIP 152][] or a separate BIP). It would be good to have it in before the activation of segwit, as otherwise compact blocks will suddenly disable.</p></article>]]></description>
