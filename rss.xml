            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The DAO: What Dreams May Come</h1><p>It hasn't been a while since the recursive call and leakage of three million ETH from the DAO, but the events continue making their turns.

But as it turns out, these monitoring devices can serve an even nefarious purpose, albeit unwillingly. Security researchers uncovered a botnet operating on 25,000 CCTV cameras. This attack targeted a small jewelry store website, which was unavailable for several days.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4fd3ff0c507ba0a8767faaa9f46bb952/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2Fshutterstock_291897773.jpg"></article>]]></description>

This time, the soft fork proposed by Ethereum developers may never occur because yet another vulnerability has been discovered. The soft fork in question is aimed at blocking target DAO address, so that the organization will not be able to effect any transactions.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/43daf90e538c441136936c6a1a20e907/noop.png?input=http%3A%2F%2Fforklog.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2F13.png"></article>]]></description>
