As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/9692e99b874ccef2d9ab003f00562429/croprotate.png?cropheight=256&cropwidth=164&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditstatic.com%2Ficon.png&x=46&y=0"></article>]]></description>
