            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Expert: Bitcoin will Never become a Reserve Currency - NEWSBTC</h1><p>According to Pavel Kravchenko of DistributedLabs, Bitcoin is not going to be a reserve currency anytime soon. It is mainly due to the hesitation of the banking sector to recognize bitcoin as a currency.
