            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What Ethereum's Fork Means for Bitcoin's Block Size Debate - CoinDesk</h1><p>Could a development on the ethereum blockchain help resolve one of bitcoin's longest-running debates?

The adjustment would appear to have taken some of the momentum out of the nascent ethereum classic blockchain, which has enjoyed notable price gains and trading volume despite the fact many analysts expected it to die of shortly after its unlikely creation.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/675d162bec1586ea5c20a13aad593eeb/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.coindesk.com%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2Ftrading-market-e1472236485560.jpg"></article>]]></description>
