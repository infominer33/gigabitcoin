            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why I declined to "verify" SN's identity two weeks ago * /r/Bitcoin</h1><p>Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/03bb1b5a93fc0720701b7f7e37541340963fd151.png"></article>]]></description>
