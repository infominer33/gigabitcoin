            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Can I mine Bitcoin?</h1><p>Answer: Don't bother. Not worth it. You can't make a profit with general purpose (non-ASIC) hardware. And even with free electricity it is so little that you could likely make more by using the time you'd need to set it up for filling out paying online surveys.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>
