            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>MAIDsafe Technical Analysis for 05/16/2016 - Price Approaching Major Pivot Zone at 0.000128</h1><p>The 0.000105 pivot area continues to be a dominant price level on the MAIDsafe charts. On the 14th, 0.000105 acted as support for a third time. Since bouncing off 0.00015, price has been rallying and is now approaching another major pivot area that may cause some problems: 0.000128, which was outlined in two of my previous MAIDsafe articles ( 05/09/2016 & 05/04/2016).</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/56b47d3cddbf2f635d1a6d07d4eb6e9bdcef3cbe.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>R3 Bank Partner Northern Trust Details Four Internal Blockchain Tests - CoinDesk</h1><p>Back in January, Chicago-based asset management firm Northern Trust was part of a group of international financial institutions to complete a blockchain test with the R3CEV banking consortium.

The new approach, which prevents clinical trial documents from being altered to make new medications look more effective, was developed by Greg Irving, of the University of Cambridge, and John Holden - both practicing doctors concerned about the trustworthiness of clinical trials.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e42e3a512f5865de403ae991cecec3f195780d17.jpg"></article>]]></description>
