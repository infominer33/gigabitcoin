            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitfinex Will Recoup Its Losses By Taking Money Out of Customer Balances</h1><p>The saga of the Bitfinex hack is far from over by the look of things. A new update provided by the company hints at how all of the exchange's users will be sharing in the losses suffered. With US$65m being stolen, this seems a very strange approach by the company, to say the last.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/67d04222a5d53e1a36769e6e7b013af5/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fthemerkle.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2Fshutterstock_134863802.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Day three post Bitfinex hack: Bitcoin bailouts, liabilities and hard forks</h1><p>On Wednesday, we argued that the loss of approximately $70m worth of bitcoin from customer segregated accounts held at Bitfinex should give the banking industry pause for thought with respect to adopting blockchain and bitcoin-based financial technologies.
