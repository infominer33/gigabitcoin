            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Greece Government Approves New Strategy To Ban Cash</h1><p>The financial situation in Greece is not improving by any means, as new regulation imposes even more restrictions.

As a quick refresher, Mt. Gox is the now-defunct bitcoin exchange that shuttered in February 2014 after a mysterious "glitch" caused $500 million worth of bitcoin to go missing. Those bitcoin - or at least most of them - have remained missing ever since.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9c0df83114dd20d9475ca9c4f2419ba18101d55e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin trading at 3102 Chinese Yuan, equivalent to $473 USD. * /r/Bitcoin</h1><p>Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money.
