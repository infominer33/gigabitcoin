            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin Price Analysis: 5/05/2016</h1><p>Bitcoin is fortifying at the top limit of a short-term flat. In order to maximize the possibility of a turn to growth, the market has to form an upward turnaround structure. Bitcoin's fortification in a zone profitable for the bears means that the bulls are currently holding the advantage, or, alternatively, there is a lack of interest from the majority of the bears at this level.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0373850b4bc83c0fa15f251889c6cf2f1ed686cc.jpg"></article>]]></description>
