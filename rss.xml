            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>I have 100$ and free electricity, how do I start bitcoin mining?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 3): To start mining Bitcoin, aside from free electricity, you need a Bitcoin mining hardware which will cost you a lot. 100$ is not enough for that.

What should I do next?</h1><p>Black bears are excellent climbers and can almost certainly climb faster than you. It is unlikely for a black bear to chase you except if it is a momma bear with cubs. A mother bear shooes her cubs up a tree for safety. Grizzly bears are lousy climbers but they can run really fast.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/2da8a7fbacd988dde66a1131ca8e7b4b/noop?input=https%3A%2F%2Fqph.ec.quoracdn.net%2Fmain-qimg-7ebef8e4ee3114e3619eb7b9c3721acb-c%3Fconvert_to_webp%3Dtrue"></article>]]></description>
