            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is it possible that a single person created Bitcoin?</h1><p>Answer: I'm not sure we'll ever know the answer to that question.

In the early days of bitcoin people like myself involved were seen as literally insane for putting their time, effort and money into "digital monopoly money".

Ethereum has hurdles ahead of it, but they are almost entir...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f557cc6fb54fd6464415c28e49775bc4f78a527b.png"></article>]]></description>
