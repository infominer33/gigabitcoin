            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>From Dell to Rakuten: 10 Most Popular Vendors That Accept Bitcoin</h1><p>Bitcoin remains the most widely used cryptocurrency, so for many online vendors it's a good alternative to the U.S. dollar. Microsoft, CheapAir and other big retail names have already jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon, with many more to follow. To be fair, most Bitcoin-accepting vendors don't accept Bitcoin directly.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ba7d3d2e8e1fdcc0449a36af19d8cce9/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fimages%2F725_Ly9jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy83YmIzNmQ0YWQ1MGFkYjUyODdmNzVjZGVjZmZjZWQzOS5qcGc%3D.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin Bail-Ins and Yuan Bets</h1><p>Bitfinex is a bitcoin exchange that suffered a $71 million hacking attack. It is not, to put it gently, the first bitcoin exchange to get hacked. Historically, the way bitcoin-exchange hacks work is that the exchange keeps all of its customers' bitcoins in a single commingled bitcoin wallet, the hackers steal bitcoins from the wallet, and the exchange then passes those losses on to its customers with a mumbled apology.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ab70d544f13771bed944a3c791bc3d9f/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fassets.bwbx.io%2Fimages%2FiOfaDpZSNRPM%2Fv1%2F120x120.jpg"></article>]]></description>

However, Apple Pay should not be discounted either, as the company is now coming to Canadian vending machines. It would be great to use cryptocurrency when purchasing something from a vending machine, but that seems a dream for now.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/2b1f29500878a9e53d45e277e1c234d6/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fthemerkle.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2Fshutterstock_172675634.jpg"></article>]]></description>
