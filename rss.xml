There is a market for child prostitutes. That doesn't mean we allow it. There is a market for slaves. And in bad economic times, there is a market for people who will work for starvation wages, especially in a country with as poor a safety net as the USA's.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/cd474c39b6a3668a6d6b037b6b291dca/noop.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fqsf.ec.quoracdn.net%2F-images.new_grid.fb_share_default.pnge6dde9cfa6e03c43.png"></article>]]></description>
