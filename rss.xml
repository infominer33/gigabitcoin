            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>ALERT: Apple Store just added another SCAM wallet. (info inside, please report) * /r/Bitcoin</h1><p>Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/750bbf205da4f90fac5fcf91865c7416/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=168&cropwidth=184&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redditmedia.com%2Fqxe3SyKBqyQWR9wJFwxgdKEJpmnTynmirkxSirK0588.jpg%3Fw%3D320%26s%3D4433c0903380c7c15e467a8b204f8593&x=64&y=0"></article>]]></description>
