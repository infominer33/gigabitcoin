            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin Price Watch; Back to Breakout - NEWSBTC</h1><p>Last night, we set up a little bit differently for the second of our twice daily analyses. Rather than outline standard support and resistance, we looked at an upward sloping triangle that offered us the opportunity to get into the markets on a scalp trade position, and use that to draw a sharp, decent downside profit.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c7b9772ea91c2f53b43033472f76ec444d8b8634.png"></article>]]></description>

You could be arrested, your weapons could be confiscated and you could face prosecution and a hefty fine. Also, how does the headline "Dog hunters arrested" with your name in the body of the news story grab you?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>
