Gox</h1><p>TOKYO-When Mark Karpeles, the CEO of what was once the world's largest Bitcoin exchange, said that the company had gone bankrupt because 800,000 bitcoins (worth nearly half a billion dollars at the time) had been hacked, he wasn't exactly lying. He wasn't exactly telling the whole truth, either, but there was an intriguing element of fact.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/84952636dbb2a25b3b7c0f39141131ed6fd5b89f.jpg"></article>]]></description>
