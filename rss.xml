            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What threats (could) exist that will destroy Bitcoin and other decentralized currencies?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 2): The main threat is usually stated as the 51% attack. This is where any organisation with 51% of the hashing power can manipulate transactions. Opinions vary on how much of a threat this actually is.
