The Senate is supposed to act as a check on the President in this aspect of governance. After all, we have a President, not a king.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

It can penetrate sufficiently to destroy vital organs and has the size and strength to cause a LOT of damage. The advantage of a bullet is not so much in it's individual killing power, but rather in the fact that it can be employed with relatively minimal training, by people who are not exceptionally strong, at a distance.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

Take American cars from the 1980's and 90's. In his movies, " Roger and Me," filmmaker Roger Moore chronicles the self-destruction of American automaker's market share due, in part, to the vehicles they produced only being designed to last 4-5 years before needing replacement, due to parts designed not to last.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0459b96b940fe53c9fdfe4a0a4e363eee1b6e240.jpg"></article>]]></description>
