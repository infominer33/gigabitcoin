            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is it safe to invest in Bitcoin in 2016?</h1><p>Solid, reliable, dependable, professional, compassionate but also tough as nails - all those things we secretly like to have but that we don't want to be seen enjoying, especially in a woman.

I know that this must baffle consumers of right-wing media who see nothing but this type of reporting.
