            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is the decentralized part of blockchain a "must have" in order to consider a particular implementation to be based on BTC?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 3): No, the only consideration needed for a blockchain implementation to be based on BTC is to use the original source code - ie making a clone of the original Bitcoin. Whether or not it is decentralised is not an issue. You can install your own instance of Bitcoin and distribute it...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f557cc6fb54fd6464415c28e49775bc4f78a527b.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Do all contracts on the blockchain have to be "smart" or can you just record static contract agreements that aren't going to change?</h1><p>Answer: Smart contracts are static contract agreements that aren't going to change. If they could change at will, they wouldn't be much of a contract, wouldn't they? :) What's "smart" about a smart contract is that it can check whether the conditions have been fulfilled - for example if you're g...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f557cc6fb54fd6464415c28e49775bc4f78a527b.png"></article>]]></description>
