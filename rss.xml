            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Can someone build a "Transferwise" application on the blockchain?</h1><p>Well, let's try it this way. The largest thing in the universe is the universe. The smallest meaningful length is the Planck length. There are 10^61 Planck lengths in the observable universe. So we'll split the difference and look for something 10^30 or 10^31 Planck lengths. That's about .01 to .1 millimeters.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/cd474c39b6a3668a6d6b037b6b291dca/noop.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fqsf.ec.quoracdn.net%2F-images.new_grid.fb_share_default.pnge6dde9cfa6e03c43.png"></article>]]></description>
