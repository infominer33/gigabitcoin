"Standard" is a more restrictive requirement, and as you say, this transaction is not standard.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/06355c9d94f3dccfd8b01770e050c7de/noop.png?input=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sstatic.net%2FSites%2Fbitcoin%2Fimg%2Fapple-touch-icon.png%3Fv%3Da43e5a337e6b%26a"></article>]]></description>
