            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin Price Watch; 700 Close, But Be Careful - NEWSBTC</h1><p>Here's what we are focusing on for this morning's session in the bitcoin price.

Primarily, this is a result of volume out of Asia, but also it seems to be a time at which markets unwind in a particular direction, and this unwinding translates to sustained volatility.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e0e57a6fd13cf63179dc444e5185706f620ff013.png"></article>]]></description>
