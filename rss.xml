Compared with academic research carried out in previous years you may have noticed that many scholarly papers in 2016 have so far focused on analyzing Bitcoin's potential future role, and in some cases examined user experiences of Bitcoin security and privacy [See: Krombholz, Judmayer, Gusenbauer and Weippl (2016); SBA Research, Vienna, Austria].</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b4478f20d9ce2da6a1f7695f3526f7040fd7e133.jpg"></article>]]></description>
