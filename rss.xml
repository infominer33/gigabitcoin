            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Will the Sky Fall in on UK from Brexit Vote Results?</h1><p>The people of the United Kingdom have historically voted to leave the European Union making it the first state in the block to do so. I believe the vote to leave was more about getting out from under the dictatorship of the unelected bureaucrats in Brussels who are lording their laws across the continent with little regard for its citizens than a separation from the countries of Europe themselves.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1070cba7458ac16fd73d2a94dd28d82e/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fimages%2F725_aHR0cDovL2NvaW50ZWxlZ3JhcGguY29tL3N0b3JhZ2UvdXBsb2Fkcy92aWV3LzE3NTVlMWVhMTZkNWRiYzk2MmVkMTBlYmMyOWI3ZDNhLmpwZw%3D%3D.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Selfrando Technique Makes Tor Nearly Invulnerable To De-anonymization Attacks</h1><p>For quite some time now, there have been concerns over how the FBI managed to unmask Tor users. Given the nature of this anonymity software, it should not be possible for law enforcement to reveal somebody's real IP address. Selfrando, a new technique developed by academics and researchers, should prevent this from happening in the future.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0abd107c3e2935664a9409ac0f5291d9/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fthemerkle.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2Fshutterstock_344810192.jpg"></article>]]></description>
