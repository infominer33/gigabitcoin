One question is the pivot point. Should Bitcoin maintain the pseudonymity that offers privacy or should government identify users through such measures as imposing Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements on exchanges?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9c4e085dafeb1a18f5863280dbe3a73f978fa25f.jpg"></article>]]></description>
