            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Banks abandon the Caribbean, local bitcoin exchange experiences 33% increase in users every month since February</h1><p>Smaller, poorer countries are being abandoned by big banks in an exodus commonly referred to as "de-risking" or "de-banking." In the Caribbean, where many small countries with poorer populations reside close to each other, the problem is getting so bad that local businesses regularly have a hard time receiving remittances and paying suppliers outside of their own country, even when their trading partner is just the next island over.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ae8084c9f750f41287cea91fe8f556c2/noop.png?input=http%3A%2F%2Fbravenewcoin.com%2Fassets%2FUploads%2F_resampled%2FResizedImage360528-Trade-percentage-of-GDP.png"></article>]]></description>
