            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin becoming popular in China as yuan slides- Nikkei Asian Review</h1><p>HONG KONG -- The declining popularity of China's currency continues, with its rate against the dollar remaining at low levels. The currency's fall against the greenback, however, has stabilized on cooler expectations for an additional rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve.

However, employers are now going through information provided by applicants' social media accounts as well, albeit they do not necessarily want to access those accounts. That may be about to change, though.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/1eb0c3476b3c7a41e471e4b3ee2b7678f5296a19.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Mining giant BTCC talks about Bitcoin price pop</h1><p>The fact that Bitcoin is undervalued is probably not news to many people involved in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Bitcoin's recent price increase, through the $500 resistance point, rallied over the weekend and is now about to cross $700 (£493, €621). The most immediate price driver is the halving of the number of Bitcoins being mined.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f7e70b28eb83052a8aa55a20d1ae60f0cea05bd0.jpg"></article>]]></description>
