            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Can bitcoins be legally counterfeited?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 2): Yes and No If you have the very very very large computational power then it is possible to make counterfeit coin. But in specification it is assumed that the majority of computational power comes from honest nodes. And upto now such seems true. But theoretically it is possible.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/2fb81fb5bcd4c440dee2d03fb2acc3c6/noop.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fqsf.ec.quoracdn.net%2F-images.new_grid.fb_share_default.png2801ad8885530345.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>So my wife had lunch with a bunch of lawyers today. She asked a tax lawyer if he had invested in bitcoin. His response...? * /r/Bitcoin</h1><p>Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/9692e99b874ccef2d9ab003f00562429/croprotate.png?cropheight=256&cropwidth=164&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditstatic.com%2Ficon.png&x=46&y=0"></article>]]></description>
