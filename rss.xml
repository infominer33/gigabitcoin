            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>I've developed an algorithm that trades Bitcoin. I want to start a fund. What should I do next?</h1><p>Black bears are excellent climbers and can almost certainly climb faster than you. It is unlikely for a black bear to chase you except if it is a momma bear with cubs.
