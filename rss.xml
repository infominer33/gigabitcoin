            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What would a blockchain decentralised government look like?</h1><p>My mother often served avocado with our meals. She'd also cook a lot of goat. And plenty of white rice. I loved avocado (and still do!) but I was never a fan of rice or goat. Especially the goat. It was tough & tender. The meat tasted bitter in my mouth.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f557cc6fb54fd6464415c28e49775bc4f78a527b.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>When will bitcoin trading be legal in India?</h1><p>Answer: I don't think it is illegal yet. In fact, RBI loved Bitcoin Blockchain. RBI wanted to block Bitcoin but a man named Nisit Desai came to save Bitcoin from RBI hate. RBI no longer hates Bitcoin. Hope RBI Governor's exit does not change the situation.
