            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Blockchain technology requires a lot of power to reach consensus for every transaction. How's it energy efficient?</h1><p>I don't think energy efficiency is a major problem. A bigger problem is that many blockchain systems (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc.) are inefficient from a computation and storage perspective. This isn't a huge problem for Bitcoin because it has been intentionally designed for transactions.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

Some kind folks donated BTC to us (we were just curious to try), but now we need some advice (being in the bush) on how to use them.. * /r/Bitcoin</h1><p>Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0620d51fcf7b4bce9e2203d3ba6f9417bb14342a.jpg"></article>]]></description>
