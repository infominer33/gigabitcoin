It gives a glimpse into the future architecture of money and finance, one that is very different to today. Understandably, the Banking industry dismisses it.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Nobody Cares About Your Early Bitcoin Adopter Status</h1><p>Nobody cares when or what price you first bought Bitcoin. Many people use this as a refrain to establish their legitimacy, but it highlights a paucity of other things which to discuss.
