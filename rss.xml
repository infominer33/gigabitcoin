            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How could the blockchain affect democracy?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 2): In terms of democratic elections, Blockchain based voting is the ultimate way to prove the following: 1.) As a citizen, to check that your ballot was officially counted 2.) Prevent lost ballots, and ensure a permanent way to review results of past elections. Also, it's a great...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is there any open source solution for blockchain?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 3): Yes, every blockchain solution is open source. Thats the entire purpose of the technology - to be open, easily accessible, auditable, and have the security/code reviewed by anyone. If however by blockchain you meant private block chains, then I'm not sure. I do know that mijin i...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is there any books for dummies to learn about blockchain and ethereum?</h1><p>Answer: I would suggest The Business Blockchain. The book gives a thorough overview of blockchain, the technologies influenced by blockchain, and describes it as a disruptive technology like the internet in the 90â€²s. Though the book does not detail "ethereum", it gives source to reader where to f...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Where do I go if I want to create a new blockchain?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 3): In short: * Yes, you can "create" a new instance of Blockchain on your PC. * No, I guess most blockchains can be developed also on Linux/Windows machines. * That depends on what you want to do. If you just want to run a clone of existing blockchain like Bitcoin - you would o...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How has gambling become more fair with blockchain?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 2): I agree with John - blockchain hasn't yet made gambling fair. However, there is potential to make it fair. The way that happens is by putting a software middleman in place.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What is your opinion about Bitcoin and blockchain technology?</h1><p>Answer: In many ways, that is two questions. Bitcoin is a payment system. Blockchain is a software technique for managing virtual ledgers that is implemented through the use of multiple computers. Bitcoin uses the blockchain as the foundation of how it works.

Then again, there are so many negative aspects associated with the money we use today; it becomes only more obvious centralised systems are on their way out.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6c609cc799f4883812fb8907c6cb5ba5839d52f7.jpg"></article>]]></description>
