            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>OpenBazaar is Here but Darknet Markets Will Remain</h1><p>Many believe a new day is dawning with the launch of the decentralized market OpenBazaar. However, it still doesn't cut the mustard when it comes to those dealing with black market goods. In fact darknet markets (DNM) are stronger than ever and have continued the legacy of the original Silk Road with much success.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a5b16594d4ae61e9828a7aa18edc7eb5bf5e9214.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ethereum (ETH) Price Trends: 5/20/2016</h1><p>The upward Ethereum trend is continuing. Ethereum's price is keeping the structure of its trend, which allows it to grow. Because the upward structure was not disrupted, there is only one option, which is the continuation of the trend. After a rebound, Ethereum's price could not break through the $13.2 support line; thus, the flat was unable to form.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8d7c8010c8eb875d6fb31102746f1f95e1236f6a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Just tried to book a flight ticket using paypal. Guess what I discovered? * /r/Bitcoin</h1><p>Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/03bb1b5a93fc0720701b7f7e37541340963fd151.png"></article>]]></description>
