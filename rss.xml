            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ethereum Technical Analysis for 05/06/2016 - Big Move Imminent?</h1><p>In my previous ETH article, I speculated about the technical significance of the 0.0218 area and how it might start acting as resistance. Since the 4th, the 0.0218 area has acted as resistance a total of four times, as well as support on two occasions.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/763ced581a9a2e5290aa9f536496c30d543769a5.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Tech News Sites Are Not Sold on Bitcoin Yet</h1><p>Despite all of the attention on Bitcoin and its alleged creator over the past week or so, most major tech sites are still not keen on Bitcoin. That may seem only normal, as Bitcoin is in direct competition with the financial entities which support these media outlets.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a4397f42b6a199fc5967c514a60790b016e0313e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why Satoshi's Identity Matters & Why It's Irrelevant for Bitcoin</h1><p>There is one credible argument about why it is important to know Satoshi Nakamoto's identity for the interests of bitcoin. His public wallets will account for about 5.5 % of the total number of bitcoin which will be in circulation after the 21 millionth - the last- bitcoin has been mined in approximately the year 2140.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d51241d1dff05aba31db674614a7974dcad586d7.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin Prices Calm Despite Craig Wright Controversy - CoinDesk</h1><p>Bitcoin has had a quiet week, experiencing low trading volume and rather modest price changes as market observers saw Australian academic Craig Wright claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin. On the other hand, ether - the native token of the Ethereum network - fluctuated far more significantly in terms of price during the seven days through 6th May.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/36bf841e08aa6b14c92552749d3c70746a7e792b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Would this scheme allow faster verification of transactions? (Multiple parallel block chains)</h1><p>One issue with one block chain is that it needs to be globally synchronized. One way to elevate this would be to use multiblock chains. Namely, we can imagine that there are N block chains, working in parallel. To make double spending impossible, a you can only spend a total of 1/N of your total money on each chain.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ef96063d625a5ef5599ed70be4b5dfc791e440fa.png"></article>]]></description>
