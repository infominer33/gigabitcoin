            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How are the costs of blockchain mining distributed?</h1><p>A small transaction and large transaction have the same "load" on the ledger - however, the implicit tax (inflation as new bitcoins issued to miners, for example) has a percentage cost to the transaction. Does this favor small transactions over large ones? Does this cause undesirable externalities?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f557cc6fb54fd6464415c28e49775bc4f78a527b.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Does global instability benefit Bitcoin? What is the explanation for this phenomenon?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 3): The price of Bitcoin is roughly the inverse of the trust people have in central banks and governments - when people start feeling threatened that something might happen to their money, the price of Bitcoin rises (demand rises, while supply is more or less constant).</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f557cc6fb54fd6464415c28e49775bc4f78a527b.png"></article>]]></description>
