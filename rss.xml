            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Could bitcoin change the game in Africa?</h1><p>In the wildest of claims, bitcoin - the virtual paperless and stateless currency transacted on the borderless internet - was going to tear apart traditional money transfer companies and help alleviate poverty.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What are the best sources to keep up to date with the latest cryptocurrency and blockchain industry developments?</h1><p>Yes. It is wisely taught that "being shot does not mean you are dead: if you can still feel pain, you can still take action." Death by GSW is not instant in most cases. It takes something very unlikely, such as a straight-on forehead, nasal cavity, or eye shot to just instantly drop someone.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f557cc6fb54fd6464415c28e49775bc4f78a527b.png"></article>]]></description>
