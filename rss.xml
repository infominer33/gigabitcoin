            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin Price Analysis (Week of May 8th)</h1><p>The upward dynamic continues on Bitcoin. If the structure of that movement isn't disrupted, it is likely to grow into a medium-term upward trend. After fortifying at a medium-term resistance line, Bitcoin's price has undergone a turn to growth. The level of $450.5 could've become the peak of a correction preceding a downward trend, but the bears were a minority.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5e54e5fd8de5e4a86d6c073bbf14f9f58a52b304.jpg"></article>]]></description>
