            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin Scam Site Warning - TInderBTC</h1><p>Now and then, users can come across a funnily-named company active in the world of cryptocurrency.

Mexicans are jokers by nature, so don't take anything too seriously and avoid being easily offended, we usually mean no harm. Be condescending.
