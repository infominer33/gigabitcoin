            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Assert Guards: Towards Automated Code Bounties & Safe Smart Contract Coding on Ethereum</h1><p>With great power comes great responsibility. Once uploaded, the code on Ethereum runs exactly as programmed... forever. That is one of the platform's core benefits: code that always interoperates as promised, can't be tampered with, and has no down time.
