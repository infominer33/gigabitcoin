            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin Bonus Program Gets Ukrainians Interested in Crypto</h1><p>Despite Bitcoin's amorphous status in Ukraine, local activists are not afraid to bring Bitcoin to the public's attention.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Where can I buy Cryptolabs' Case cold bitcoin wallet?</h1><p>I support Donald Trump. American politics is boring. The democrats and GOP have settled into a stalemate that will take decades or a disaster to unravel. No one cares about Rand Paul, although he has the right ideas. So Trump. Thinking of him as a wrecking crane, a catalyst of change.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What factors will determine the value of ether and ethereum?</h1><p>Answer: Like Bitcoin, the fiat "value" of ETH is determined by those who buy and sell it alone. The currency is used to pay for smart contracts within the Ethereum network, so one might say that Ether tokens are "backed" by the value that these smart contracts provide.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>
