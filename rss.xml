            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What Are the Use Cases for Private Blockchains? The Experts Weigh In</h1><p>Many people argue that private blockchains, run by private firms, are useless, since they make users dependent upon a third party â€’ the firm managing the blockchain. Many believe that private blockchains currently being considered are not blockchains, but rather, distributed ledger technology which has already existed.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/6dd08bdf4e24af20c68d282b0fc342ba/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Ffs.bitcoinmagazine.com%2Fimg%2Farticles%2Fwhat-are-the-use-cases-for-private-blockchains-the-experts-weigh-in.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin node Decentralization</h1><p>Yes, independently operated nodes help decentralization more than the same number of nodes operated by a single entity. That's basically the definition of "decentralization" in this context. That is not to say that a single organization running multiple full nodes does not add to overall network health, since those nodes still participate in relaying transactions and providing historical blocks.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/06355c9d94f3dccfd8b01770e050c7de/noop.png?input=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sstatic.net%2FSites%2Fbitcoin%2Fimg%2Fapple-touch-icon.png%3Fv%3Da43e5a337e6b%26a"></article>]]></description>
