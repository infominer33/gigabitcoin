            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin Scam Site Warning - GoldFinanceCorp</h1><p>Any company offering an hourly return to investors should never be trusted. It is just impossible to provide a guaranteed hourly restitution of any investment to a user unless their deposit is not being spent at all. Moreover, if no funds come in from other investors, the question becomes how companies such as GoldFinanceCorp can even hope to survive.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d35117775f08ee4bf8aaeaed8bee88d3/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fthemerkle.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F07%2Fshutterstock_175051037.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Will the Brexit and China Continue to Influence Bitcoin Prices? - CoinDesk</h1><p>In the previous weeks, macroeconomic uncertainty has spurred investment interest in bitcoin, but is this likely to continue? As we covered last week in our H1 2016's market analysis, prices have pushed up 50% from 1st January, and two key drivers were, at least according to market observers, uncertainty in China (where the yuan has been devalued) and Europe (where the UK voted to leave the EU in an event known as the ' Brexit').</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/2b4a67954bd7908c32b8b99438d86656/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.coindesk.com%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F07%2Fuk-china-e1468000983185.jpg"></article>]]></description>
