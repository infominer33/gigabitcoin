            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How is blockchain technology being applied to medicine?</h1><p>Most food in Rome during the classical period was take-away, fast food, prepared in street stalls.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is Bitcoin the future of the world currency system?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 2): Bitcoin will definitely not progress beyond a niche currency.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, action overnight in the bitcoin price was relatively muted. The federal holiday in the US led to a pretty soft volume level, and this eradicated any real chance of sustained momentum.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b8b017bb488f3a0079397cdd72ff4ffb/noop.png?input=http%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fmain-newsbtc-images%2F2016%2F07%2F05100125%2FScreen-Shot-2016-07-05-at-10.54.01.png"></article>]]></description>

There was only one option after that kind of development - to continue its downward movement as a correction towards the long-term upward trend.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/df98705857d1eb3e9f382c20d552009c/croprotate.png?cropheight=578&cropwidth=1269&degrees=0&input=http%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fstorage%2Fuploads%2Fview%2Fc1afda42277e286909c4e239389139ff.png&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>
