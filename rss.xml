            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>I recently put most of my trading funds in Bitfinex because with BitGo and per-customer wallets my deposits were insured up to $250k. Now Bitgo has removed all information on insurance. WTF?! * /r/Bitcoin</h1><p>Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/9692e99b874ccef2d9ab003f00562429/croprotate.png?cropheight=256&cropwidth=164&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditstatic.com%2Ficon.png&x=46&y=0"></article>]]></description>

We all know what happened swiftly after that, though: Wright's initial proof didn't withstand scrutiny; two days later he promised "extraordinary proof," which never came; and then, a day after that, he left a mysterious message on his website that said "goodbye."</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/14ce637ec76d6ef257433a03b6c7a317/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.arstechnica.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2016%2F08%2F89538102_craig_wright-640x359.jpg"></article>]]></description>
