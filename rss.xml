            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Swarm Decentralizes Storage and Bandwidth Through Ethereum</h1><p>A new distributed storage platform has been announced, called Swarm.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ethereum (ETH) Price Trends: 5/11/2016</h1><p>Ethereum's price has reached a key short-term level. An upward trend can begin at that resistance level. Ethereum has cautiously reached the level of $9.5, from which it can quite likely rebound in the future. The bears can prove themselves at that mark and the downward correction could continue.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f46dcf4a299d69301d05bebccce23a23b66587ca.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>With Bitcoin, Hiding Assets in Divorce Is Risky, But It Pays</h1><p>Can you really hide assets in a divorce through Bitcoin? CoinTelegraph investigates the feasibility of such a suggestion. In most cases, assets in divorce are hidden through relatively simple means with varying legality. That includes transferring money from joint accounts to private accounts; transferring assets to a friend prior to the divorce; undervaluing assets; or simply storing assets as cash in a hidden safety deposit box.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7223d25b8ea0838b39f9872690f9587b73ee2682.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin May Help Criminals, But Blockchain Can Help Thwart Fraud</h1><p>We all know bitcoin as an edgy and anonymous cryptocurrency. It provokes strong opinions. Department of Justice officials reference it in connection with real-life crimes, just as made-up bad guys reference it in movies.
