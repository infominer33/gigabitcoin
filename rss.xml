            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin Hard Forks May Become Safer With User Voting</h1><p>Up to this point, the main way to judge support for a change to Bitcoin's consensus rules has been miner voting. Miners are able to broadcast support for changes to the Bitcoin protocol via coinbase transactions, and these messages of support are tabulated in an effort to judge the level of support among those who are theoretically incentivized to support the network.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/07237548dfa9ab455f7ef84fffed3c76b0710b68.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Opt-In RBF is a change to the memory pool and network relay code and gives wallets the option to add a signal to transactions that gives permission for full nodes to update the particular transaction.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e289bbe9d29fb99e2a31214231687cf7420601d0.jpg"></article>]]></description>
