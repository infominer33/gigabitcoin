            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Sandjacking iOS Exploit Threatens Bitcoin and Ethereum Wallets</h1><p>Albeit Bitcoin and Ethereum wallets have only recently started appearing on the iOS App Store; cryptocurrency users will need to be extra vigilant.

Both industries will tend to thrive in places where the profit margins are highest...and there's no profit margin in building a port in a land-locked city.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ef96063d625a5ef5599ed70be4b5dfc791e440fa.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How does ethereum work?</h1><p>Assuming they kept a majority in the Senate, yes, they could. However, I think they would pay very dearly for it, and it might destroy the party. I do not believe the American electorate would stand for that. In fact, my prediction is that it won't happen, because the Republican party knows how much damage it would cause.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>
