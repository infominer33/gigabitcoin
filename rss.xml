Bitcoin wallets have no physical presence, and they do not require expensive assistance to create and maintain. Bitcoin is especially attractive to workers in the gig economy who exchange skills for money.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e489f40263bcbe1b90eb51ac029b36c8/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cryptocoinsnews.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2FGig-eco-watch.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Being a president doesn't = "snarky one line flinging machine." Note: I'm not going to vote for Rubio unless the Democrats nominate a Mugabe/Hitler ticket. (And who has that kind of money anymore? You've gotta clone the latter and fake naturalization records for the former and what with the DNC having done that for Obama it just doesn't seem in the cards).</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/cd474c39b6a3668a6d6b037b6b291dca/noop.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fqsf.ec.quoracdn.net%2F-images.new_grid.fb_share_default.pnge6dde9cfa6e03c43.png"></article>]]></description>
