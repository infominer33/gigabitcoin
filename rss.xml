            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin Price Analysis: 4/15/2016</h1><p>A turn to decline didn't happen, which means that the upward trend is to continue. Bitcoin's price now stands a chance to reach $445. The lack of a downward trend means that the bulls are holding the advantage. The majority of the traders were expecting the price to grow, at least in the medium-term scale.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/569a6a9f8e519c2571dd1faf5f6165aab994cba3.jpg"></article>]]></description>
