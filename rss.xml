Chamber of Digital Commerce president Perianne Boring is a public supporter of this new law. Bitcoin and regulation are two topics that will hardly ever go hand-in-hand these days. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory has been signing a lot of legislative proposals as of late.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ece5814174653f366fae416a55d4b167/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fmain-newsbtc-images%2F2016%2F07%2F07093636%2Fshutterstock_77245495.jpg"></article>]]></description>
