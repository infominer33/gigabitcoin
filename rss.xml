            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What are the best sources to keep up to date with the latest cryptocurrency and blockchain industry developments?</h1><p>Yes. It is wisely taught that "being shot does not mean you are dead: if you can still feel pain, you can still take action." Death by GSW is not instant in most cases.
