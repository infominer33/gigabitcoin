According to developer and cryptocurrency enthusiast Charles Hoskinson, it's the stage reached after both "decentralized currency" and "smart contract" applications are achieved - the point at which governance and self-funding are addressed. But is that really the best order in which to achieve 3.0 status?</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/945defa1f37458b47c48cf6f624d5a2d/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F07%2FBrain-Network.jpg"></article>]]></description>
