Accessing the multibillion-dollar remittance flows to Africa certainly has substantial appeal, perhaps helping to attract some large seed investments in African bitcoin startups.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1cb4ce5166ebdf96c06f5de4c124e60d/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fi.guim.co.uk%2Fimg%2Fmedia%2Fd6599974eeff6dc64f5849f7f274cc4efef5c419%2F0_0_4950_2969%2F4950.jpg%3Fw%3D1200%26h%3D630%26q%3D55%26auto%3Dformat%26usm%3D12%26fit%3Dcrop%26bm%3Dnormal%26ba%3Dbottom%252Cleft%26blend64%3DaHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n%26s%3Dcc82d2830a2d7a3612d5b7b80a97e92e"></article>]]></description>
