            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Florida judge has ruled that Bitcoin isn't money</h1><p>Ever since it moved into the mainstream Bitcoin has had a bit of an identity crisis. Mainly because no one is really sure whether it should be considered money or property. The IRS says it's property for tax purposes, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission says it's a commodity, and most Bitcoin advocates like to say it's the world's most advanced currency.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c74366a96b76421fa06b87d0f08138e3/noop?input=https%3A%2F%2Ftctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com%2F2014%2F12%2Fbitcointug.png%26h%3D400%26crop%3D1"></article>]]></description>

Miami Beach detective Ricardo Arias, working undercover as an identity thief, flipped them in front of Michell Abner Espinoza. A "flash-roll," it's called, the kind you see in the movies where bad guys flick through wads of cash before holding it up in the air.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4df4706e26a60b247847b2bbee3b41f0/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.washingtonpost.com%2Frf%2Fimage_1484w%2F2010-2019%2FWashingtonPost%2F2014%2F07%2F18%2FBusiness%2FImages%2F2014-07-11T175802Z_01_BTE317_RTRIDSP_3_FRANCE-BITCOIN-763.jpg"></article>]]></description>
