            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Can blockchain technology reduce bureaucracy? How?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 2): Blockchain technology is really good at one thing: reliable reconciliation.

Bureaucracy technically refers to a government where d...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>
