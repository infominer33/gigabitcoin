            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why Dumb Networks Are Better</h1><p>In computer and communications networks, decentralization leads to faster innovation, greater openness, and lower cost. Decentralization creates the conditions for competition and diversity in the services the network provides. But how can you tell if a network is decentralized, and what makes it more likely to be decentralized?</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin security model: Trust by computation</h1><p>First February 2014 in O'Reilly Radar Bitcoin is a distributed consensus network that maintains a secure and trusted distributed ledger through a process called "proof-of-work." Bitcoin fundamentally inverts the trust mechanism of a distributed system. Traditionally, as we see in payment and banking systems, trust is achieved through access control, by carefully vetting participants and excluding bad actors.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Great comments John, thanks.</h1><p>Great comments John, thanks. All valid points. I wouldn't consider this article an exhaustive analysis of the incentives and the impact of segwit, so thanks for offering additional analysis. I especially appreciate the input about rewarding full nodes, something that other chains have incorporated in their design and could potentially be a useful addition for a future upgrade of bitcoin.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f01f29ae29b418baee6a537ea9c33e7e/noop.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-images-1.medium.com%2Ffit%2Fc%2F60%2F60%2F0*tTZN03LAxAD9moWf.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Segregated Witness and aligning economic incentives with resource costs - Decentralize Today</h1><p>Bitcoin mining nodes and full nodes incur costs for the resources used to support the bitcoin network and the blockchain. As the scale of bitcoin increases, so does the cost of resources (CPU, network bandwidth, disk space, memory). Miners are compensated for these costs through fees that are proportional to the size (in bytes) of each transaction.</p></article>]]></description>
