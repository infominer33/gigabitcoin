However, it is the first time TransferWise is doing so, even though they have not been overly kind to Bitcoin so far. Cashila and ICONOMI users can no longer receive funds through Transferwise, which is rather annoying when making a deposit.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/8a35b267b6957119cf8739ddcd4b7a1c/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fthemerkle.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F07%2Fshutterstock_101809123.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A lot of us here hate on and criticize Ethereum and Altcoins, when in truth we can learn a lot about their respective success and failures * /r/Bitcoin</h1><p>Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/9692e99b874ccef2d9ab003f00562429/croprotate.png?cropheight=256&cropwidth=164&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditstatic.com%2Ficon.png&x=46&y=0"></article>]]></description>
