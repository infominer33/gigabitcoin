            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin Price Analysis - A quiet week comes to an end</h1><p>The technical setups posted below use simple trend detection, support and resistance, channels, pattern and candle analysis. We aim for high-probability trade setups on BTCUSD and use very few indicators. All charts use BNC's Bitcoin Liquid Index for maximum accuracy. The timeframe for trades is 1 to 7 days, so we'll use 4h candlesticks.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/152c0321728bf0ec145f9c4e1b666e0606a7cc2b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why most bitcoin mining farms are hidden or not publicly shown?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 3): From my experience, most legitimate cloud mining operations would be more than happy to share photos of their "mines". Cloud mining and bitcoin mining are some of the most googled phrases around Bitcoin. This is due to the hype around them. It is getting more difficult to trust ...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>I want to instantly buy bitcoin in the next 10 minutes, where is the best place to do that on the internet?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 4): Probably the website Bitcoin Ranger. It has developed a solid reputation for being the "convenience store of bitcoin". It's also one of the few places where you can buy bitcoin with Paypal. Because buying bitcoins with Paypal or credit card should be easy! ~~</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What sort of math problems are involved in mining bitcoin?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 3): Bitcoin mining is guessing, over and over, a value that gets added to the header of the block you are trying to mine. Each time, once you fill in your guess, the header is put through the SHA-256 hash function twice.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Can java be used for high frequency trading?</h1><p>Answer: In US liquid markets, "high frequency trading" strategies are usually implemented in C/C++, if not at FPGAs / RDMA adapters, which would shut a Java-based HFT implementation out of the market. However, your strategy is effectively "high frequency" if your code is faster than mostly every...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What are my options if I want to start a money transfer service between US and China?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 2): Actually tried to do this and gave up. Now I'm doing China-Africa. You don't want to start a money transfer service between China and the United States unless you have about US 2-5 million to pay for all of the licenses you need in the US.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>
