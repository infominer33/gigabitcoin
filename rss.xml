            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Three Eastern European Exchanges Are In Hot Water Over ETC Tokens</h1><p>Although using cryptocurrency is very much frowned upon in Russia, Bitcoin exchanges do exist. Unfortunately, some of these platforms are suspected of defrauding users. More specifically, these exchanges have not distributed Ethereum Classic tokens to their rightful owners.

The Abra-like services largely provide a better user experience on the front-end, and routing optimization (for cost, speed, etc.) on the back-end.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/2fb81fb5bcd4c440dee2d03fb2acc3c6/noop.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fqsf.ec.quoracdn.net%2F-images.new_grid.fb_share_default.png2801ad8885530345.png"></article>]]></description>
