            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why do services like abra build on top of the Bitcoin blockchain instead of building their own blockchain?</h1><p>Most services like Abra do not build on only the blockchain. Instead, they build on many different payment rails, including the traditional banking system. The Abra-like services largely provide a better user experience on the front-end, and routing optimization (for cost, speed, etc.) on the back-end.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/2fb81fb5bcd4c440dee2d03fb2acc3c6/noop.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fqsf.ec.quoracdn.net%2F-images.new_grid.fb_share_default.png2801ad8885530345.png"></article>]]></description>
