            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Book on Blockchain Earns Mixed Review in the Wall Street Journal</h1><p>A book called "Blockchain Revolution" about the workings and potential benefits of bitcoin and blockchain technology gained an extensive, though somewhat skeptical review in yesterday's Wall Street Journal editorial page.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>EB133 - Pascal and Julien Hamonic: Applying the Mechanisms of Thermoregulation to Cryptocurrencies</h1><p>One of the problems often cited when talking about cryptocurrencies is their level of volatility compared to traditional fiat currencies. This makes most cryptocurrencies a poor instrument for storing value, and introduces complexities when making purchases in fiat amounts. Stable cryptocurrencies include mechanisms which allow them to stay pegged to fiat currencies like the US Dollar or Euro.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b9260fa67a76f4a50cedc80ef9c32cb43017845e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Will the blockchain only play a role in the global community or will it also become important for local communities?</h1><p>Answer: I am not sure if it is because of global or local. Internet related technology is always global by nature, and used local anywhere on earth. It already played a role in Greek crisis, when banks were closing, all of a sudden bit-coin atms appeared. Then blockchain technology has potential ...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What's the easiest way to give a friend from a different country bitcoin when they have zero technical knowledge of bitcoin?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 3): Personally I'd have them start by educating themselves. I'm a bit biased, but I always send people to my site, Incorporating Bitcoin, to learn. As they go through the learning process, help them out by sending them bitcoin. I've found a fun way to show people how easy it is is to...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin price jumps 21 percent over 4 days, reaching a 21-month high</h1><p>Bitcoin is back! Or at least, there are positive signs indicating that bitcoin might not be as dead as everybody thought. Bitcoins are now trading at $547.40 on Bitfinex (the largest USD/bitcoin exchange according to Bitcoinity). And it represents a big 21.4 percent price jump over just 4 days.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a048cff47ee8b7be397e2b16429575280542e4ae.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Banks Can't Afford to Ignore Bitcoin's 'BitTorrent Effect'</h1><p>Today, major banks are touting their mobile banking apps as the next best thing. But are these "innovations" or just renovations on the proverbial deck of the Titanic? And similar to how BitTorrent impacted the entertainment industry, would incumbent banks have remained complacent without a prod from Bitcoin?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/1775edc843eb435036f3c28a09b2d0f10954d4f7.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What is the relationship between blockchain and smart contracts?</h1><p>Answer: They are part of the same hype, but really they shouldn't be the same thing. I seem to be one of the few people that have actually used smart contracts in a real business setting, and one important business requirement is that the contract be able to function outside of a blockchain.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How would SWIFT using blockchain improve its security and guard against the recent spate of cyber attacks?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 2): SWIFT is primarily a private network, the network itself did not get breached. As with any security concern, it's only as strong as it's weakest link. Namely the end points, who sends or receive messages and how this environment is secured. SWIFT as an entity is only responsible...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>
