            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Centralized Monetary Systems Need To Be Replaced</h1><p>There has been a lot of discussion as to why the banking ecosystem needs to change, rather than to stick to its centralised model. Then again, there are so many negative aspects associated with the money we use today; it becomes only more obvious centralised systems are on their way out.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6c609cc799f4883812fb8907c6cb5ba5839d52f7.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What is the best book about bitcoin?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 2): The best book is hard to answer because bitcoin is so so dynamic. The surface has not be discovered therefore only a few scratches have been made or attempted. I suggest (from a close friend and Expertpreneur) Read Satoshi's White Paper. This is the whole concept of it's Creator...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Can blockchain technology reduce bureaucracy? How?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 2): Blockchain technology is really good at one thing: reliable reconciliation. So if I say I sent you $10 but you say you didn't receive it, we don't have to have a battle of opinions and just refer to What the Blockchain Says. Bureaucracy technically refers to a government where d...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Does Coinbase represent a failure of Bitcoin idea?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 6): Coinbase doesn't represent a failure of the bitcoin idea any more than keeping money in a bank represents a failure of fiat currencies. If anything, we are way behind the curve on allowing banks to hold bitcoin for their customers.
