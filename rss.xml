            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is there a lot of innovative blockchain activity in Russia?</h1><p>Answer: Cryptocurrencies are currently illegal in Russia, so I would assume there is very little. Though with that said, its only blockchains of the public form that are illegal, so there very well might be a lot of innovation in the private blockchain industry, but i doubt it.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f557cc6fb54fd6464415c28e49775bc4f78a527b.png"></article>]]></description>
