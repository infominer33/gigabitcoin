            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>From Dell to Rakuten: 10 Most Popular Vendors That Accept Bitcoin</h1><p>Bitcoin remains the most widely used cryptocurrency, so for many online vendors it's a good alternative to the U.S. dollar.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin Bail-Ins and Yuan Bets</h1><p>Bitfinex is a bitcoin exchange that suffered a $71 million hacking attack. It is not, to put it gently, the first bitcoin exchange to get hacked. Historically, the way bitcoin-exchange hacks work is that the exchange keeps all of its customers' bitcoins in a single commingled bitcoin wallet, the hackers steal bitcoins from the wallet, and the exchange then passes those losses on to its customers with a mumbled apology.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ab70d544f13771bed944a3c791bc3d9f/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fassets.bwbx.io%2Fimages%2FiOfaDpZSNRPM%2Fv1%2F120x120.jpg"></article>]]></description>
