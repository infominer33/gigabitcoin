            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What are the most expensive things one can buy with bitcoins?</h1><p>Because the supposedly left-wing (read: professional) press doesn't report innuendo or orchestrate political smear campaigns. I know that this must baffle consumers of right-wing media who see nothing but this type of reporting. The facts here are that a woman claims that Trump raped her 22 years ago, when she was 13, at a sex party.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/e1bdaa6c016a26b5897aecb27dd3f93a/noop.jpeg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fqph.ec.quoracdn.net%2Fmain-custom-t-913-600x315-fwuhfunzeiyqlztwawzffuidhkltyvtz.jpeg"></article>]]></description>
