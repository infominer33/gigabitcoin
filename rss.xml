            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How can blockchain technology impact the travel industry?</h1><p>Blockchain is a shared public ledger underlying the Bitcoin network. It chains transactions together in blocks which are then encrypted. This makes these transactions extremely difficult for hackers to access the information. It also creates a permanent record of all payments as blockchains exist forever and can't be removed.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e8d5b7def645451c5c4328c97f2687f7/noop.jpeg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fqph.ec.quoracdn.net%2Fmain-custom-t-1393740-600x315-tjtbwiqofezszbgbqrtunqerutuchpmn.jpeg"></article>]]></description>
