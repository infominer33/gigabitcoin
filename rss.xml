            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Consumers Have No Access To Pound Sterling Due To Foreign Exchange Shortage</h1><p>One of the more worrisome side effects of the Brexit is how consumers are struggling to buy Pounds Sterling.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Selfrando Technique Makes Tor Nearly Invulnerable To De-anonymization Attacks</h1><p>For quite some time now, there have been concerns over how the FBI managed to unmask Tor users. Given the nature of this anonymity software, it should not be possible for law enforcement to reveal somebody's real IP address. Selfrando, a new technique developed by academics and researchers, should prevent this from happening in the future.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0abd107c3e2935664a9409ac0f5291d9/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fthemerkle.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2Fshutterstock_344810192.jpg"></article>]]></description>
