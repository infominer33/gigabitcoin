            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Sandjacking iOS Exploit Threatens Bitcoin and Ethereum Wallets</h1><p>Albeit Bitcoin and Ethereum wallets have only recently started appearing on the iOS App Store; cryptocurrency users will need to be extra vigilant. A new hack allows attackers to switch legitimate applications with malicious versions.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What can be done to slow/prevent mining centralization?</h1><p>Asking how to prevent the mining industry from being centralized into places with low electricity costs is like asking how to prevent the shipping industry from being centralized into cities that are on the coast. Both industries will tend to thrive in places where the profit margins are highest...and there's no profit margin in building a port in a land-locked city.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ef96063d625a5ef5599ed70be4b5dfc791e440fa.png"></article>]]></description>
