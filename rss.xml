            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>In search of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin's mysterious creator</h1><p>The English-speaking world has long had a love affair with literature that attempts to describe experience from the point of view of another species. Henry Williamson is perhaps the best-known British chronicler of the beast's inner world: his early forays, particularly Tarka the Otter (1927) and Salar the Salmon (1935), are considered classics of the genre.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c5d1515dc2f6e8ef2e0977bcd02fc5a78567bc31.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Does the Lightning Network Threaten Bitcoin's Censorship Resistance?</h1><p>The Lightning Network may well be Bitcoin's primary solution to the issue of scalability, but many skeptics believe there are unresolved issues with this layer-2 system for the blockchain. The possibility of too much centralization via so-called "supernodes" is one of the common criticisms of the Lightning Network, and attached to that is the fear of these new, mostly -centralized payment hubs having the capacity to censor transactions.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d8bd5fae749ab7fa2f524b90b2dba82a2d488490.jpg"></article>]]></description>
