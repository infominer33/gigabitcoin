            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What happens when the Blockchain gets too big?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 4): The real thing that happens is that the number of transactions per second gets really, really slow. It's one of the drivers for the development of sidechain technology, so that none of the transactions exclusive to the sidechain ever hit the main blockchain, only those affecting...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is there any books for dummies to learn about blockchain and ethereum?</h1><p>Answer: I would suggest The Business Blockchain.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How has gambling become more fair with blockchain?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 2): I agree with John - blockchain hasn't yet made gambling fair. However, there is potential to make it fair. The way that happens is by putting a software middleman in place.
