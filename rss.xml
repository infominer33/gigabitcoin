            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin Worth $200 More Than Current Valuation, Says New Report</h1><p>A new report published by investment bank, Needham & Company, suggests that Bitcoin is undervalued by potentially as much as 58%, or $200, at the moment. Bitcoin is currently valued at around $412, but this is obviously subject to change at any time, but the report suggests that Bitcoin should in reality be valued at around $655, an increase of around 58%.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/821321b5a8855c472402995c2be0d819b63f01de.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Experimenting With DIY Mineral Oil Submersion Cooling</h1><p>The summer will soon be upon us and yet again will start causing issues with the cooling of GPU and ASIC miners for a lot of people. This is why we have started doing some experiments with cooling using mineral oil to submerge a miner and using a traditional water cooling hardware for achieving more efficient, silent and problem free cooling during the coming higher temperatures.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/254136930bf22dab14043b196fa102b373ddcc5c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Amit Kumar Feels Bitcoin Plays A Role In Terrorism Funding</h1><p>What seems more likely, however, is how organizations like IS get their funding through money laundering, a scheme that has been plaguing traditional finance for quite some time. The topic of the involvement of Bitcoin in terrorism funding has been kicked around a few times in the past, but it looks like there is no end in sight.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f7f8a08e0a262e7a6aab843315032c4a85885a3b.jpg"></article>]]></description>
