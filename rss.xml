            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Blockchain won't kill banks: Bitcoin pioneer</h1><p>Blockchain - the technology that underpins the cryptocurrency bitcoin - is unlikely to kill banks despite warnings from top industry executives, the chair of a bitcoin non-profit organization told CNBC on Monday. Last week, Andrey Sharov, a vice president at Russia's Sberbank, said banks would disappear by 2026 due to the rising use of blockchain technology.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d90b5b4ec9ac84c3bfae77a0fdfe2c9810393046.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Donald Trump Presidency Would Increase Bitcoin Remittances To Mexico</h1><p>If it's not remittances , immigrants in the US will figure out a way to send their money home if they want to do so. For now, it's not going to be Bitcoin. But, if Trump does block remittances, you better believe that sooner than later increasing numbers of remitters will look into this blockchain technology.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ab4c894d67983b7970ef1756387249c5b1f136dc.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How to Prove You're Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto</h1><p>Four months have passed since the world learned the name of Craig Wright, a man who, as WIRED wrote in December, either created Bitcoin or very badly wants someone to believe he did. Now rumors are swirling through the Bitcoin world that Wright himself is poised to publicly claim-and possibly offer some sort of proof-that he really is Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious inventor of Bitcoin.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2229c7917446880a059b0a540b05e5f8f139b641.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin Worth $200 More Than Current Valuation, Says New Report</h1><p>A new report published by investment bank, Needham & Company, suggests that Bitcoin is undervalued by potentially as much as 58%, or $200, at the moment. Bitcoin is currently valued at around $412, but this is obviously subject to change at any time, but the report suggests that Bitcoin should in reality be valued at around $655, an increase of around 58%.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/821321b5a8855c472402995c2be0d819b63f01de.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Experimenting With DIY Mineral Oil Submersion Cooling</h1><p>The summer will soon be upon us and yet again will start causing issues with the cooling of GPU and ASIC miners for a lot of people. This is why we have started doing some experiments with cooling using mineral oil to submerge a miner and using a traditional water cooling hardware for achieving more efficient, silent and problem free cooling during the coming higher temperatures.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/254136930bf22dab14043b196fa102b373ddcc5c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

The topic of the involvement of Bitcoin in terrorism funding has been kicked around a few times in the past, but it looks like there is no end in sight.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f7f8a08e0a262e7a6aab843315032c4a85885a3b.jpg"></article>]]></description>
