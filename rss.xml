            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Does Dash Have a Coin Cap, or Is It Infinitely Inflationary?</h1><p>Whether a coin has a maximum supply (like Bitcoin's 21 million) or is infinitely inflationary (like Ethereum) has significant effects on that coin's usage. For example, people tend to save that which is limited in supply, and that they tend to spend that which is inflationary in supply.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4fc29d451f0a5d9965d682166cae44e4/noop.png?input=http%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2Fdash-supply.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>I've developed an algorithm that trades Bitcoin. I want to start a fund. What should I do next?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 3): Starting with 1-2 bitcoin, trade your algo quietly for a year. If it shows amazing performance then put more of your own money in and continue. If it shows mediocre performance, try raise a fund. That's what the pros do.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/625b588d429b8b111707443b86d96fbb/noop.jpeg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fqph.ec.quoracdn.net%2Fmain-custom-t-6815-600x315-yxkfgzsliamduhcujtnggvbowygdsmtj.jpeg"></article>]]></description>
