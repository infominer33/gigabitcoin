            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The pound has officially become more unstable than Bitcoin</h1><p>The British pound has become more volatile than Bitcoin. Bitcoin has long been thought to be the world's most unstable currency - moving from being worth $2 to $1,137 in the last five years. But that wildly volatile currency is now becoming a safe refuge when compared to the fluctuations in the pound.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e5cf7a33e307950693fbeb1e2ebddb2c/noop.png?input=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.independent.co.uk%2Fs3fs-public%2Fthumbnails%2Fimage%2F2016%2F07%2F10%2F11%2Fscreen_shot_2016-07-10_at_09.55.27.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Dark Clouds Gather Over Deutsche Bank As Collapse Looms</h1><p>It will be impossible for Deutsche Bank to continue their operations as normal and pretend there is nothing wrong. The story of Deutsche Bank being a systemic risk to the global economy is far from told. If this vast European institution would collapse, the European economy will see significant shockwaves for many years to come.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/8b6a0f39ad5a06ddfbd9fcf8d482f954/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fmain-newsbtc-images%2F2016%2F07%2F10104402%2Fshutterstock_352566386.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Law Enforcement Still Monitors Bitcoin To Arrest Deep Web Users</h1><p>Perhaps the most common way to track down deep web users is by infiltrating the marketplaces themselves.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Tor-inspired Privacy Features Are Coming To Mozilla Firefox</h1><p>In a surprising turn of events, the Mozilla team has announced they will be adding more privacy features to their upcoming Firefox releases.
