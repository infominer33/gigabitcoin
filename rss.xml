            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ethereum (ETH) Price Trends: 6/02/2016</h1><p>Ethereum's price is fortifying above a key resistance line. A short-term flat, which is also a rebound, is coming to its conclusion. The movement which has started at $10, could become a wave of a medium-term flat. As long as that probability is there, there is a chance for a downward turn towards $10.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a3c9d2ac7ac9c62f7c449d89a7fa4d7a414fdcd3.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ethereum (ETH) Price Trends: 6/03/2016</h1><p>Ethereum's price is approaching an important resistance line.
