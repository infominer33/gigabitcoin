Even as governments around the world have begun cooperating to nab suspected tax cheats, virtual bitcoin wallets filled with the cryptocurrency possess the potential to become what University of California-Irvine law professor Omri Marian has dubbed " super tax havens."</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/7f9ef702c6d7c3c00fb6165b720e211c/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=1000&cropwidth=1500&degrees=0&input=http%3A%2F%2Fmotherboard-images.vice.com%2Fcontent-images%2Farticle%2F34928%2F1466619212584526.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>
