            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Emergence of Blockchains as Activity Registers - CoinDesk</h1><p>Antony Lewis is a bitcoin and blockchain consultant, who previously served as the director of business development at bitcoin exchange itBit. In this article, Lewis attempts to describe two very different uses for blockchain technology and why the division of these two functions is increasingly of interest to enterprise firms.
