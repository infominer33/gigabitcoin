This need for regulation, he says, springs from the risks Bitcoin introduces and opportunities its decentralized nature presents for tax-evasion and money-laundering.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/1f960b7904a3bdb8e86b2a25fc045129ad9e060e.jpg"></article>]]></description>
