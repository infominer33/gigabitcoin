            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ethereum (ETH) Price Trends (Week of August 1st)</h1><p>Ethereum's price is at the bottom limit of the medium-term flat. The odds are stacking in favor of an upward movement. The movement, which has broken through the key support level around $14 is a wave of correction towards the downward trend.
