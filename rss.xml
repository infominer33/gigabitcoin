            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>So my wife had lunch with a bunch of lawyers today. She asked a tax lawyer if he had invested in bitcoin. His response...? * /r/Bitcoin</h1><p>Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/9692e99b874ccef2d9ab003f00562429/croprotate.png?cropheight=256&cropwidth=164&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditstatic.com%2Ficon.png&x=46&y=0"></article>]]></description>
