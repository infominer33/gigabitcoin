            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What are the advertising agencies that support webmoney/bitcoin?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 2): Yes they are. Actually I know two because they had media impact some time ago. * The first there's Joystick Interactive, a London-based marketing agency which works with big brads such as Toyota, Google, Disney among others. What they looked accepting bitcoins is to embrace f...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[What is bitcoin kernel?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What is bitcoin kernel?</h1><p>Answer: As far as I know there is no such thing as a bitcoin kernel. SHA 256 is an algorithm. SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) is a cryptographic hash function. 256 denotes that it is 256 bits, or 32 bytes, in length. Hash means that it is a one way function.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why will bitcoin work? It seems to me that owners hoard rather than spend. Why would this change?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 5): Bitcoin probably won't work. It was never intended to be a major currency - it's a test for reaching consensus without any trusted third party. A very successful test at that. Bitcoin's success is a problem because the code was not meant for the purpose, and it is not easy to a...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is it worth it to mine Bitcoin if I have no power costs?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 6): I think your best bet would be to invest in a nice GPU card and mine an altcoin. Then you can exchange the altcoins for bitcoins. Here is a website where you can compare the profitability of various alternative currencies. Cryptocurrency Mining vs. Bitcoin Mining Profitability ...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin Price Analysis - A quiet week comes to an end</h1><p>The technical setups posted below use simple trend detection, support and resistance, channels, pattern and candle analysis. We aim for high-probability trade setups on BTCUSD and use very few indicators. All charts use BNC's Bitcoin Liquid Index for maximum accuracy. The timeframe for trades is 1 to 7 days, so we'll use 4h candlesticks.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/152c0321728bf0ec145f9c4e1b666e0606a7cc2b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why most bitcoin mining farms are hidden or not publicly shown?</h1><p>Answer (1 of 3): From my experience, most legitimate cloud mining operations would be more than happy to share photos of their "mines". Cloud mining and bitcoin mining are some of the most googled phrases around Bitcoin. This is due to the hype around them. It is getting more difficult to trust ...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe701abb234b33e2f69d4800b738211912cdb2e8.png"></article>]]></description>
