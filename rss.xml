            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin node Decentralization</h1><p>Yes, independently operated nodes help decentralization more than the same number of nodes operated by a single entity. That's basically the definition of "decentralization" in this context. That is not to say that a single organization running multiple full nodes does not add to overall network health, since those nodes still participate in relaying transactions and providing historical blocks.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/06355c9d94f3dccfd8b01770e050c7de/noop.png?input=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sstatic.net%2FSites%2Fbitcoin%2Fimg%2Fapple-touch-icon.png%3Fv%3Da43e5a337e6b%26a"></article>]]></description>
