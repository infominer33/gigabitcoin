            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is it possible that a single person created Bitcoin?</h1><p>Answer: I'm not sure we'll ever know the answer to that question. Satoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonym of the "person or people" that created Bitcoin, but there is doubt over who or whom that is, as the Wikipedia page attests.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How does the emergence of ethereum compare to the early days of bitcoin?</h1><p>Answer: Bitcoin was the trailblazer. In the early days of bitcoin people like myself involved were seen as literally insane for putting their time, effort and money into "digital monopoly money". We have come a long, long way since then. Ethereum has hurdles ahead of it, but they are almost entir...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f557cc6fb54fd6464415c28e49775bc4f78a527b.png"></article>]]></description>

Being (somewhat) uncomfortable is so much better for you. Take the job you are not sure you can do. Routine. We crave it. We look for it. We settle into it. It completely dulls our senses.
