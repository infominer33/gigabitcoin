            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The DAO Holds Over 38% of Entire Ethereum Supply</h1><p>The DAO remains a success story to keep an eye on, as they have overtaken the Ethereum Foundation regarding holding Ether. Keeping in mind how this smart contract currently holds over 38% of the entire ETH supply, interesting things are bound to happen to the Ethereum price.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5ed155c8b6d5821ad8f9a1677e0237834d1b04f3.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why Satoshi's Identity Matters & Why It's Irrelevant for Bitcoin</h1><p>There is one credible argument about why it is important to know Satoshi Nakamoto's identity for the interests of bitcoin. His public wallets will account for about 5.5 % of the total number of bitcoin which will be in circulation after the 21 millionth - the last- bitcoin has been mined in approximately the year 2140.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d51241d1dff05aba31db674614a7974dcad586d7.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin Prices Calm Despite Craig Wright Controversy - CoinDesk</h1><p>Bitcoin has had a quiet week, experiencing low trading volume and rather modest price changes as market observers saw Australian academic Craig Wright claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin. On the other hand, ether - the native token of the Ethereum network - fluctuated far more significantly in terms of price during the seven days through 6th May.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/36bf841e08aa6b14c92552749d3c70746a7e792b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Would this scheme allow faster verification of transactions? (Multiple parallel block chains)</h1><p>One issue with one block chain is that it needs to be globally synchronized. One way to elevate this would be to use multiblock chains. Namely, we can imagine that there are N block chains, working in parallel. To make double spending impossible, a you can only spend a total of 1/N of your total money on each chain.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ef96063d625a5ef5599ed70be4b5dfc791e440fa.png"></article>]]></description>
