It's not even a particularly difficult task - although it may be quite demanding in the sense that it's something you would have to get exactly right. The difficult part was coming up with the idea. But Satoshi put it in the public domain, and once you know what you're aiming for, i...</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/2fb81fb5bcd4c440dee2d03fb2acc3c6/noop.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fqsf.ec.quoracdn.net%2F-images.new_grid.fb_share_default.png2801ad8885530345.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Building The Bridge: Why Compliance Is Key To Digital Currency's Success - Stories From Coinbase</h1><p>I occasionally see people in the digital currency industry question the value of compliance. By this I mean working with regulators, law enforcement, banks, etc. This isn't surprising given that many of the early adopters of bitcoin are privacy advocates, and much of the world of compliance is about knowing your customer.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/3c118ca55969b40194c57c251481d519/noop.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-images-1.medium.com%2Fmax%2F1200%2F1*Cp-c_65YLGpFqJN8YUSLjw.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Snowden tweets private key hash, then deletes it, why? * /r/Bitcoin</h1><p>Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/9692e99b874ccef2d9ab003f00562429/croprotate.png?cropheight=256&cropwidth=164&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditstatic.com%2Ficon.png&x=46&y=0"></article>]]></description>
