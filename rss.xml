As it turns out, some of his passwords were used for LinkedIn as well, and hackers abused those credentials after the list of passwords was dumped last month.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f3514732fc1d7b7a05e512777e34bb8bd0e9ade1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Gemini Bitcoin Exchange Enters Canadian Market</h1><p>What makes Canada so appealing for exchange platform operators is how there is no specific regulation in the country. Ever since the Winklevoss twins launched their Gemini exchange platform, things seem to have quieted down quite a bit. Until earlier today, that is, as the company announced it will expand its business to Canada.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/113d68ee2b76d10537401c7a8e7d80699661eff2.png"></article>]]></description>
