  Last month, the European Commission published a draft directive proposing to
  extend anti-money laundering (AML) regulation to both virtual currency
  exchange services and custodial wallet providers. The draft suggests that many
  Bitcoin companies operating within the European Union will need to apply
  know-your-customer (KYC) types of checks on their users, to be enforced by
  2017.
