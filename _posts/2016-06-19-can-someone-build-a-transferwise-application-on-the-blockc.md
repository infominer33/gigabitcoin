  Well, let's try it this way. The largest thing in the universe is the
  universe. The smallest meaningful length is the Planck length. There are 10^61
  Planck lengths in the observable universe. So we'll split the difference and
  look for something 10^30 or 10^31 Planck lengths. That's about .01 to .1
  millimeters.
