  Some people in the Bitcoin space may remember the Sheep Marketplace. This
  darknet forum started gaining a lot of momentum after Silk Road was shut down.
  Unfortunately, Sheep was shut down in March 2015, and its founder was arrested
  at the same time. Apparently, he also stole Bitcoins worth several million
  belonging to platform users.
