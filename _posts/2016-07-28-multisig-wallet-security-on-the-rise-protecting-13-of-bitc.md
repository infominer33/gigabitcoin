  Today, 13% of Bitcoin is protected by multisig technology. A growing minority
  of Bitcoin users employ a multi-signature wallet, which uses more than one
  private key to access the wallet. By using this approach, wallets are much
  less vulnerable to security breaches, as no single party possesses all the
  information necessary to decrypt the wallet.
