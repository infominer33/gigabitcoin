  Bitcoin mining nodes and full nodes incur costs for the resources used to
  support the bitcoin network and the blockchain. As the scale of bitcoin
  increases, so does the cost of resources (CPU, network bandwidth, disk space,
  memory). Miners are compensated for these costs through fees that are
  proportional to the size (in bytes) of each transaction.
