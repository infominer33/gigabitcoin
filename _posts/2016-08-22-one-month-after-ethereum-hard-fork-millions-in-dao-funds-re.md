  It's now been one month since a hard fork of the ethereum blockchain resulted
  in 11.6m ether being moved to an account with one function: withdraw. At the
  time, that was about $145m worth of the digital currency just waiting for
  former investors, and within hours of its creation, nearly half of those funds
  had been claimed.
