  Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide,
  decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars,
  bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever:
  there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is
  more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks.
