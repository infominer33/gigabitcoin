      We write a lot about Twitter tips and Facebook tips and less so about
      other places like LinkedIn. Part of it is that we're still keen to figure
      out our best strategy here. And we thought, in the midst of our figuring
      things out, it'd be great to share with you what we've found so far!

      That's how many people viewed my blog content on LinkedIn last year. Those
      16 million page views led to 300,000 followers, thousands of sales leads
      and books sold and more than $1 million of revenue. I'm super lucky. I've
      been part of the LinkedIn Influencer program and that's been a huge part
      of my success.

  Despite LinkedIn dealing with a massive data breach not too long, the company
  is still attracting a lot of positive attention. So much even that Microsoft
  will acquire the company for US$26.2bn, all of which is to be paid in cash.
  The social network for professions will retain its brand and CEO, though.
