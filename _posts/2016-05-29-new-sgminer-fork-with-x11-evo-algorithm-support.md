description: 'There is now an sgminer fork for GPU mining Revolvercoin (XRE) that uses a new X11 Evo algorithm ( source) for AMD GPUs. The new X11 Evo algorithm comes as a solution to the already available ASIC miners for the standard X11 algorithm, meaning that X11 Evo is only CPU and GPU mineable for the moment, though CPU mining with a GPU miner available is not very reasonable.'
