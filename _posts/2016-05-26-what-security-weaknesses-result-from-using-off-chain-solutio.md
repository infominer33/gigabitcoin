description: 'With the Lightning network specifically, the security of the transactions always depends on being able to take the transaction onto the real blockchain "if needed". When both parties cooperate, the the number of on chain transactions is minimized, but both parties rely on being able to cash out, using the real blockchain, if the other party stops cooperating or goes offline for an extended period of time.'
