  NO-NOs for MEXICO: Have thin skin. Mexicans are jokers by nature, so don't
  take anything too seriously and avoid being easily offended, we usually mean
  no harm. Be condescending. (Taken from another answer I just posted): Mexico
  has a long history of being a cultural hub, so we love hosting tourists and
  we're good at it.
