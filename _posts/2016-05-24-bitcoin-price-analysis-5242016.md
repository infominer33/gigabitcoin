description: "Bitcoin's price continues forming a movement near the top limit of the flat. The formed short-term trend could grow into the first wave of the medium-term upward trend. The structure responsible for the formation of the upward trend, now that it has broken through the top limit of the flat at $442.2, will evolve into an upward movement of a larger scale, if Bitcoin's price manages to fortify at that mark."
