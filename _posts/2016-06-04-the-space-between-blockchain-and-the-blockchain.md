  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, a center right, liberal conservative German
  paper founded in 1949, recently wrote a long article about the catchword after
  Bitcoin: the Blockchain. Or, as the article sometimes puts it, "the
  Blockchain." The article at many points takes on a sarcastic tone, poking fun
  at the many wild theories about the potential of the "Blockchain" which
  proponents tout beyond the use-case of Bitcoin.
