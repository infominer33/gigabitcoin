  Segwit review Compactblock testing CPFP status & other pending pull requests
  There aren't a lot of people interested in doing the softfork backports for
  0.11 and there isn't a lot of user interest for it either. The backport of
  BIP68 is particularly complex and might be more dangerous than not doing a
  release at all.
