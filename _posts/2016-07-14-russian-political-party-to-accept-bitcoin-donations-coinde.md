  Reports from Russia indicate a minor political party is moving to accept
  bitcoin donations. The Party of Growth, a center-right party formed in 2009
  under the name Just Cause, is reportedly looking to begin accepting donations
  in the digital currency. The move is notable given the Russian government's
  complicated and long-controversial stance on digital currencies like bitcoin.
