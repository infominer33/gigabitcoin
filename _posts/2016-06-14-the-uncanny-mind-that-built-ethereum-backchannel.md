  Vitalik Buterin invented the world's hottest new cryptocurrency and inspired a
  movement - before he'd turned 20. I met Vitalik Buterin for the first time in
  Miami, during a Bitcoin conference in 2014. I had been invited by a Bitcoiner
  I knew in New York to stay at a beach house with a team of developers who were
  working on the next big thing, a technology called Ethereum.
