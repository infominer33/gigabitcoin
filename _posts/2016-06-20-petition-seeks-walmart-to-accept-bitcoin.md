  Signatories are being asked to sign a new petition from Change.org to get
  Walmart to accept Bitcoin payments directly as consumers struggle to spend
  their bitcoins on everyday purchases. For many digital currency enthusiasts
  acquiring bitcoins is the easy part; however, for many it's not always so easy
  spending it, particularly when it comes to everyday expenses such as grocery
  shopping.
