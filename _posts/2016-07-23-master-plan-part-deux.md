  The first master plan that I wrote 10 years ago is now in the final stages of
  completion. It wasn't all that complicated and basically consisted of: Create
  a low volume car, which would necessarily be expensive Use that money to
  develop a medium volume car at a lower price Use that money to create an
  affordable, high volume car Provide solar power.
