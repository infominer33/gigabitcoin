  It feels like we only hear about Bitcoin when the price is either tanking or
  skyrocketing. And, since it's currently skyrocketing, let's talk about
  Bitcoin! As of writing, Bitcoin is hovering around $745 per coin. It has only
  been worth this much twice before - once on the way up to the height of the
  Christmas 2013 bubble, and once on the way down.
