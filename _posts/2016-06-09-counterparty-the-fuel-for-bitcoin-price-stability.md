  Bitcoin has managed to move one step further up the financial stairway,
  reaching $581 USD as of press time. While the jump isn't as large as its
  predecessor, the price of bitcoin hasn't been this strong in well over a year,
  and many are breathing a long sigh of relief and hoping things continue to
  stay this way.
