  While LBRY is still in Beta and you need to request an invitation in order to
  be able to get early access to the platform (currently only available for Mac
  OSX and Linux), people have been mining the LBRY Credits (LBC) for a while now
  on AMD via the dedicated sgminer fork or on CPU, but today tpruvot has updated
  his ccMiner fork ( source) with the final 1.8 release that adds support for
  LBRY Credits mining on Nvidia GPUs as well.
