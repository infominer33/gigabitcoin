  The Radeon RX 480 was released onto the GPU market without much fanfare, sold
  as a mid-range card at a low price - which is exactly how it performs. Despite
  the excitement in the gaming press about AMD's Polaris architecture and the RX
  (and upcoming Pro WX) line of GPUs, particularly about the card's price point,
  it seems to have been glossed over by the crypto mining community.
