  Bitcoin has a number of properties that give it utility (and thus value)  such
  as  trustlessness, permissionlessness, transparency, and immutability. When
  you broaden your perspective of bitcoin from a currency and payment system to
  that of a secure historical ledger, it becomes clear that these properties, in
  conjunction with each other, can enable powerful applications.
