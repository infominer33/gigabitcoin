      A new service is offering bitcoin users an answer to the common question:
      what is the optimum transaction fee? Using network data from the past
      three hours, CoinTape lets users compare the current waiting times
      associated with various fee tiers, calculated in satoshis per byte. It
      claims to predict delays with 90% confidence.

      A new VoIP service allows you to hide who you are by being web-based,
      having no registration checks, allowing you to spoof caller identity, and
      pay by Bitcoin. Bitphone calls itself the Bitcoin Payphone. As well as
      taking Bitcoin, the service accepts more than forty other altcoins.
