  Millions of dollars worth of ether remain unclaimed from a smart contract
  established for the purpose of allowing investors in The DAO to recover funds
  compromised in the project's demise. Of the 11.6m ETH moved to the contract by
  way of a change in the code made to the underlying ethereum platform earlier
  this week, nearly 60% of the funds, or about 6.85m ETH, have so far been
  withdrawn.
