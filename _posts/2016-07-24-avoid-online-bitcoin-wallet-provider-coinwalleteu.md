  There are many different services active in the world of Bitcoin and
  cryptocurrency. Particularly online wallet services can be hit-and-miss, as it
  is difficult to distinguish legitimate offerings from outright scams.
  Coinwallet.eu falls into this latter category, as they do not respond to
  customer inquiries and do not pay out funds either.
