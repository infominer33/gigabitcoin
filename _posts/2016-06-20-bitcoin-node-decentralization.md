  Yes, independently operated nodes help decentralization more than the same
  number of nodes operated by a single entity. That's basically the definition
  of "decentralization" in this context. That is not to say that a single
  organization running multiple full nodes does not add to overall network
  health, since those nodes still participate in relaying transactions and
  providing historical blocks.
