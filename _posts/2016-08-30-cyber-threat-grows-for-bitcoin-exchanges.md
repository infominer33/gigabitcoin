  NEW YORK When hackers penetrated a secure authentication system at a bitcoin
  exchange called Bitfinex earlier this month, they stole about $70 million
  worth of the virtual currency. The cyber theft -- the second largest by an
  exchange since hackers took roughly $350 million in bitcoins at Tokyo's MtGox
  exchange in early 2014 -- is hardly a rare occurrence in the emerging world of
  crypto-currencies.
