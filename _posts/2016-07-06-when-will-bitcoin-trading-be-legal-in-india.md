  I think he's probably highly skeptical of her, yeah. But as long as she
  cooperates and doesn't put a toe out of line it's in his interest to humor her
  and assume she's being genuine. With both Tommen and Margaery persuading
  people to support the Faith, it's in the Sparrow's interest not to antagonize
  her even if he thinks she's acting.
