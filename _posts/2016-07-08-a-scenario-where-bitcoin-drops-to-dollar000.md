  In just a couple days, the Bitcoin community will celebrate its next block
  halving. Every four years, as coded by its pseudonymous creator Satoshi
  Nakamoto, the Bitcoin network is scheduled to reduce coin supply by 50%. In
  2012, it went down from 50 bitcoins per block to 25 bitcoins per block, and in
  a few days, it will become just 12.5 coins per block.
