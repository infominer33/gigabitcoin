  The second so-called Bitcoin "block halving" is fast approaching. This week,
  as three-quarters of all bitcoins have been mined, the block subsidy will
  decrease from 25 bitcoins per block to 12.5. A key event in Bitcoin's history,
  eagerly anticipated by some - and perhaps somewhat feared by others.
