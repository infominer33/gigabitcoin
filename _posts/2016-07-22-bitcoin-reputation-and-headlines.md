  Bitcoin is one of the most ambiguous currencies in the world. Certainly, there
  is Zimbabwe Dollar, a currency used in toilet paper's stead, as actual toilet
  paper is worth more than itself, and, when used, it has way more backing.
  Zimbabwe Dollar's reputation is a fine example of what may happen when an
  economy collapses.
