  The altcoins' volatility has decreased. As it usually happens, a trend is
  followed by a period of calm, which is then followed by a new trend.
  Ethereum's price could not fortify at an important level of $16. There was
  only one option after that kind of development - to continue its downward
  movement as a correction towards the long-term upward trend.
