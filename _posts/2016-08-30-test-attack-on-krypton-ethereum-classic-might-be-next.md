  Krypton, Ethereum-based network, has recently recovered from a 2-step attack
  which resulted in a total of 21,465 KR, approximately $3000 USD, being stolen
  from Bittrex 's wallets. The Krypton team suspects that the attack might have
  been just a test: attackers might go for other Ethereum-based blockchains such
  as ETC, for example.
