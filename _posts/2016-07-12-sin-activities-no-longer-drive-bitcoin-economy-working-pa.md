  A soon-to-be-released study centers on evidence that bitcoin's market has
  matured to a point where commerce is no longer driven by illicit activities.
  Drafted by researchers from the central bank of Germany, University College
  London and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the paper argues that bitcoin
  has passed through three distinct phases of growth as a distributed payment
  system, the most recent and current of which they assert is driven by
  "legitimate payments, commerce and services".
