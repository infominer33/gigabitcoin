  Editor's note: This is a guest post by Steve Patterson and the opinions
  offered are those of the author alone. Until recently, I've remained undecided
  about the DAO failure. Should Ethereum soft fork, hard fork or do nothing? I
  have a tentative conclusion: the best reaction is to do nothing.
