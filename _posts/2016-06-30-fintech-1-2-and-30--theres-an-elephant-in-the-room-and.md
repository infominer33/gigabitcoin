  I was piqued by Victor Matarranz's [SEVP Head of Group Strategy and Chairman's
  Office, Banco Santander] presentation at MoneyConf last week, mainly because
  he began by talking about Fintech 1.0 versus Fintech 2.0. Fintech 1.0 he
  defined as the emergence of peer-to-peer lenders and new payments companies
  between 2010 and 2014.
