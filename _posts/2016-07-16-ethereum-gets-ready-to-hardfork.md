  Exchanges, miners, developers, users and ethereum's entire ecosystem is
  getting ready for a historical and defining hardfork. Kraken, eth's biggest
  exchange after Polonix, announced traders will be offered only one option, eth
  on the longest chain. If other exchanges follow Kraken's example, which is
  likely, a chain split is practically impossible save for, at worst, a couple
  of hours.
