  It's no secret that crypto-ransomware has become a huge problem for
  cybersecurity over the last few years. The powerful tools typically encrypt
  files on an infected computer, and extort a bitcoin ransom from victims. In
  2015, the Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's CYBER and
  Counterintelligence Program, Joseph Bonavolonta, said that " the ransomware is
  that good " that the agency "often advise people just to pay the ransom."
