  Bitcoin right now is not really anonymous. While Bitcoin addresses aren't
  necessarily linked to real-world identities, they can be. Monitoring the
  unencrypted peer-to-peer network, analysis of the public blockchain, and Know
  Your Customer (KYC) policy or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulation can
  reveal a lot about who's using Bitcoin, and for what.
