  The FBI has no plans to halt their efforts in trying to break consumer privacy
  down brick by brick. A new proposal would let the law enforcement agency track
  tattoos by compiling a database of images. Doing so would let the agency
  develop recognition algorithms. Tattoos are becoming more popular than ever
  before, as people want to express themselves in a creative way.
