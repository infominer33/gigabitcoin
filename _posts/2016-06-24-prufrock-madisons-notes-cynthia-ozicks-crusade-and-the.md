  Reviews and News: Cynthia Ozick's long crusade: In 1978, she argued that
  Harold Bloom's conception of poetry as a self-enclosed system that referred to
  nothing but itself...was a form of idolatry. The very idea of belatedness, so
  central to Bloom's theory, was, in Ozick's view, anathema to the Jewish
  tradition, according to which there were no latecomers.
