  Ethereum is still forming a sideway movement. The situation is heating up. The
  resolution is likely to come in a form of a powerful impulse. The length of
  the current flat is a result of a rebound towards the medium-term upward trend
  taking place. Consequently, after this flat ends, a medium-term movement will
  follow.
