  The Bank of England has released new research suggesting that a central
  bank-issued digital currency could lead to an increase in gross domestic
  product (GDP). The conclusions were drawn from the working paper published
  today that examined how a central bank-backed digital currency (referred to as
  a CBDC in the paper) could yield macroeconomic benefits, while providing
  banking regulators a clearer picture of the financial system.
