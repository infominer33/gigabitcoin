  After one week, Razormind claims that the crowdsale for its Blockchain powered
  DeOS (Decentralized Operating System) raised 2,947 BTC (US $1,936,031) in
  exchange for DEOS tokens, the platform's provisioning currency. DeOS is a
  global public Blockchain service, which will allow users to securely register
  their assets, identities, auditable records and data and run smart contracts
  without the pay-as-you-go 'gas' model as with Ethereum.
