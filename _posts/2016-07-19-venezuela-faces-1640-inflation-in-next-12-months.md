  It goes without saying the economic situation in Venezuela is anything but
  reassuring right now. The country has been plagued by food shortages and
  economic mismanagement, causing significant inflation. Experts predict
  inflation rates will soar to 1,600% in 2017, which is insane. But at the same
  time, this could be a turning point for Bitcoin.
