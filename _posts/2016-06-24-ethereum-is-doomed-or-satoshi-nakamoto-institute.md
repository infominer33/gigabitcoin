      A message from Josh Tyrangiel -Josh Tyrangiel You are an educated,
      successful person capable of abstract thought. A VP doing an SVP's job.
      Your office, appointed with decent furniture and a healthy amount of
      natural light filtered through vertical blinds, is commensurate with
      nearly two decades of service to the craft of management.

  As some have noted, I did not understand Ethereum very well when I wrote my
  previous article that touched on it. I dismissed Ethereum as just another
  altcoin with extra bells and whistles. However, there was a huge opportunity
  hiding in there, open to anyone who understood the system well enough.
