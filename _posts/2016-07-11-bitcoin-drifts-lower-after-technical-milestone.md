  The virtual currency bitcoin made it through a closely watched technical
  milestone with a 2% decline. The price of the alternative currency, measured
  in dollars, dipped Saturday in light trading by about 4%, but then recovered
  some ground to trade only about 2% lower than it did early in the day,
  according to bitcoin tracker Coindesk.
