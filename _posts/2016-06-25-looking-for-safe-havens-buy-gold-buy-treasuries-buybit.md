  The usual safe-haven trades are the only silver linings in an ugly Friday
  trading session. The iShares Barclays 20+ Yr Treas.Bond (ETF) ( TLT) is up 2.7
  percent and the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) ( GLD) is up 4.6 percent. However,
  another investment alternative may be emerging as the safe haven of the
  future.
