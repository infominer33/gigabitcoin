      In 1984, a researcher named Roger Ulrich noticed a curious pattern among
      patients who were recovering from gallbladder surgery at a suburban
      hospital in Pennsylvania. Those who had been given rooms overlooking a
      small stand of deciduous trees were being discharged almost a day sooner,
      on average, than those in otherwise identical rooms whose windows faced a
      wall.

  I just saw this on a Youtube video and here I am to share it with my fellow
  Quorans. Sloths are very, very slow movers. They do that to conserve energy
  because they only eat some kind of leaves which hardly provides any calories
  and takes forever to digest.
