      In its relative short history, bitcoin - and its underlying technology the
      blockchain - have captivated thinkers around the world, but not everyone
      was quick to see the potential. Due in part to its initial billing as a

      for the technology.

  $500 for the first time since 2014, it's safe to say the digital currency is
  once again back in the mainstream spotlight as an investment opportunity.
  However, what may be most notable is that the gains took place amid strong
  overall sentiment.
