  Bitfinex is reportedly offering a reward worth up to $3.6m for the recovery of
  bitcoins stolen from its exchange last week. The Hong Kong-based digital
  currency exchange lost nearly 120,000 BTC in the incident (an amount worth
  roughly $71m at press time), and it now suggests it's willing to offer 5% of
  these funds (or about 6,000 BTC) as a reward should they be found and
  returned.
