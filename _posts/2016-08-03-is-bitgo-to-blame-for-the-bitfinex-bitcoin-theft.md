  In light of the recent Bitfinex attack, BitGo revealed a rather interesting
  statement. The company claimed their own investigation has yielded no evidence
  of a breach of any of their servers during the Bitfinex attack. This is rather
  strange, as all of the missing funds was drained from multisignature wallets,
  which should be secured by BitGo's technology.
