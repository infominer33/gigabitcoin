  After one year of imprisonment, Mark Karpeles was recently released on
  $100,000 bail. The beleaguered former CEO of Mt. Gox, a bitcoin exchange
  launched from Tokyo in 2010, that went bankrupt after handling approximately
  70% of all bitcoin transactions. The year in prison has dampened Karpeles
  interest in Bitcoin, as he tweeted he does not care about the price currently.
