  There are exciting times for Ethereum traders, as the price seems to be
  correcting upwards again. Slowly but surely, the value per Ethereum is going
  up, although it is only occurring through minor increments. Bitcoin trading
  volume is still down by quite a margin, but the price seems to be holding
  steady so far.
