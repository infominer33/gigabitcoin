  Bitcoin was supposed to be the currency of the future: secure, fast,
  independent of any government. But if there's one feature a currency needs,
  it's to let you pay for things. And, recently, that's been a problem for
  Bitcoin. The idea was always that when technical problems arose, the bitcoin
  community would come together to solve things.
