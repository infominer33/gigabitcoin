  Bitcoin.org is warning that the Bitcoin Core, the
  as-close-to-official-as-it-gets version of Blockchain consolidation software
  and Bitcoin wallets, has likely been compromised. "Bitcoin.org has reason to
  suspect that the binaries for the upcoming Bitcoin Core release [version
  0.13.0] will likely be targeted by state sponsored attackers," the
  organisation says in a post that does not elaborate which state may be be
  behind the threat or the nature of any attack.
