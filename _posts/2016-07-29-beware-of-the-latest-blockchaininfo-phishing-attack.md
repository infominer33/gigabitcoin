  It appears as if there is yet another phishing email being sent out to
  Blockchain.info users. It is not the first time this takes place in the
  Bitcoin world, as cryptocurrency owners are a high-profile target for internet
  criminals these days. The email in question redirects people to
  Blockshain.info, which is clearly a fake website.
