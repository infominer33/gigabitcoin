  Bitcoin's price is undergoing a correction toward the long-term upward trend.
  For how long will this correction last, and at which point is the long-term
  upward trend most likely to continue? One of the key long-term levels was near
  $760-80. A long-term downward trend has been forming along that price as far
  back as 2014.
