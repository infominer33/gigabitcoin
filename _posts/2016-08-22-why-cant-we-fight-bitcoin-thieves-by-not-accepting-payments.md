  It really isn't possible to create a blacklist of stolen bitcoins. While it is
  possible to easily trace stolen bitcoins, thieves can utilize a number of
  services, such as bitcoin mixing services, that mix stolen bitcoins with other
  (sometimes even freshly mined) bitcoins before redistributing the bitcoins to
  new wallet addresses.
