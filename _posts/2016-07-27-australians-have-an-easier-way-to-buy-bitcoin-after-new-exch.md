  The first licensed bitcoin exchange to launch in the United States, has just
  set up shop in Australia. Through Coinbase, Aussies can now buy two digital
  currencies, bitcoin and ether, using their credit or debit cards through the
  San Francisco-based company. For the moment, the platform won't allow
  Australians to sell digital currency, just buy it.
