  Russia's love-hate relationship with digital currency continues. One minute
  officials are threatening to punish bitcoin operatives and traders, the next
  minute they are suggesting that citizens can use bitcoin "in areas where such
  activities are legal." A few days ago, Cryptocoinsnews said that Russia's
  announcement that it would penalize whoever is involved in bitcoin operations
  would "end two years of speculation" on Russia's stance.
