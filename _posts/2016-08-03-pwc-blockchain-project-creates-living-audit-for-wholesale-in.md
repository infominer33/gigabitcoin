  PwC has released details on a new proof-of-concept (PoC) it says successfully
  created a real-time audit process for policy creation in the wholesale
  insurance market. The professional services firm launched the project earlier
  this summer in partnership with think tank Z/Yen's Long Finance initiative,
  describing it at the time as a "high-level policy placement flow" that would
  reimagine how policies could be accepted by prospective clients.
