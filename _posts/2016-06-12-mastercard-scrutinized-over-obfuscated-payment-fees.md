      Shoppers could potentially enjoy lower prices as a result of new rules
      that will slash the sometimes "unfair" fees imposed on retailers when
      customers pay for items with plastic, the government has said. These fees,
      paid by retailers each time an individual pays for something using a card,
      will be capped from 9 December 2015 following an EU ruling.
