  Seafile is a file sharing company operating out of Germany. That is not out of
  the ordinary, except they were forced by PayPal to comply with stricter KYC
  rules. The company decided not to do so and promptly saw their PayPal account
  suspended. As a result, Seafile is now accepting Bitcoin payments through
  BitPay.
