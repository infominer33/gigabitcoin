  Bitcoin.com recently got together with Bitcoin developer Daniel Krawisz to
  discuss his new creation Shufflepuff - a coin tumbling tool, which tested its
  first transaction on August 15. But while Krawisz, a well-known writer and
  founder of the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute, is a strong proponent of
  cryptocurrency privacy, he would never support Altcoins such as Dash, or
  Monero as he believes all altcoins are basically snake oil.
