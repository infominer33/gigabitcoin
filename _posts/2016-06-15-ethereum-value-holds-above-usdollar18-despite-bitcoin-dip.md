  Albeit Ethereum has lost a small portion of its value; the cryptocurrency is
  still worth more than US$18. That is rather unexpected, as ETH peaked at
  slightly over US$19 yesterday. Despite what most people had anticipated, the
  value did not decline by much, albeit USD trading seems to be going through a
  rough patch right now.
