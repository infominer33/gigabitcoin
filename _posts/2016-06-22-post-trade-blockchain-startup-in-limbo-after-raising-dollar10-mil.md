  Sweden-based blockchain startup Cryex is pushing back against reports it is
  seeking capital to stay afloat, instead pinning its lack of outward momentum
  and low earnings on a slow regulatory environment. Rising to prominence in May
  2015 with $10m in funding, Cryex was among the first startups to explore
  blockchain technology in post-trade, a proposition that attracted investors
  including White Star Capital and Northzone Ventures.
