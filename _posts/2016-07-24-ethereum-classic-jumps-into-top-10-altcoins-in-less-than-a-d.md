  The Ethereum Hard-Fork has been a highly divisive event on the cryptocurrency
  landscape. The hard fork, along with a rescue soft-fork in the weeks prior,
  has been a godsend to those who invested in The DAO, a smart contract built on
  Ethereum that ended in one of the most catastrophic implosions in Crypto
  history.
