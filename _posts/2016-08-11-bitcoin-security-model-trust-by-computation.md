  First February 2014 in O'Reilly Radar Bitcoin is a distributed consensus
  network that maintains a secure and trusted distributed ledger through a
  process called "proof-of-work." Bitcoin fundamentally inverts the trust
  mechanism of a distributed system. Traditionally, as we see in payment and
  banking systems, trust is achieved through access control, by carefully
  vetting participants and excluding bad actors.
