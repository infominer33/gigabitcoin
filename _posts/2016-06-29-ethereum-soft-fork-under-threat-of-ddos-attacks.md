  The situation around the attempts to bring back the lost assets of The DAO is
  gradually gaining farcical shades. This time, the soft fork proposed by
  Ethereum developers may never occur because yet another vulnerability has been
  discovered. The soft fork in question is aimed at blocking target DAO address,
  so that the organization will not be able to effect any transactions.
