  Heavy demand in China has propelled bitcoin's price to $643 and the total
  value of all bitcoins in circulation to $10 Bn, which is higher than Twitter
  Inc's market capitalization ($9.5 Bn). Heavy selling of the Chinese Yuan in
  exchange for Bitcoin has been the prime driver of the rapid increase in
  Bitcoin's price.
