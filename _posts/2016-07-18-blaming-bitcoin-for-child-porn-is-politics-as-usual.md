      A bitcoin entrepreneur and a trading veteran have partnered on a
      blockchain project that aims to streamline the way assets are exchanged.
      SETL will use its blockchain, which is "akin to proof-of-stake", to let
      market participants cut out the web of intermediaries in the post-trade
      system, saving them time and money.

  Unlike financial privacy, the issue of child porn so distasteful that most
  people shy away from questioning the motives or tactics of those who crusade
  against it. That's a mistake. It gives a blank check to those who use this
  tragedy as a political opportunity to quietly impose policies that might
  otherwise hit a brick wall.
