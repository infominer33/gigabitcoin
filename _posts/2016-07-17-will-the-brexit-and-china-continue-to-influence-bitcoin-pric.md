  In the previous weeks, macroeconomic uncertainty has spurred investment
  interest in bitcoin, but is this likely to continue? As we covered last week
  in our H1 2016's market analysis, prices have pushed up 50% from 1st January,
  and two key drivers were, at least according to market observers, uncertainty
  in China (where the yuan has been devalued) and Europe (where the UK voted to
  leave the EU in an event known as the ' Brexit').
