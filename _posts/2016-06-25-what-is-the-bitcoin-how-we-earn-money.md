  What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a form of digital currency, created and held
  electronically. No one controls it. Bitcoins aren't printed, like dollars or
  euros - they're produced by people, and increasingly businesses, running
  computers all around the world, using software that solves mathematical
  problems. It's the first example of a growing category of money known as
  cryptocurrency.
