  Technical indicators suggest that the bitcoin price could be preparing for a
  rather significant correction, potentially sending it below $600. Traders
  shouldn't have too much to fear though, as the decline is expected to be
  followed by bullish activity, resulting in a rise to $700 and beyond, hitting
  resistance at $1000.
