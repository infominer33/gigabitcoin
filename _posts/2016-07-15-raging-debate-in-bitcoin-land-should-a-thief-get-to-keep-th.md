  When millions of dollars are stolen from investors, those investors usually
  want their money back right away. In the world of virtual currencies, it isn't
  that simple. After an unknown hacker raided an experimental online venture
  capital fund called DAO in June and spirited away $60 million worth of a
  virtual currency called ether, the fund's creators came up with a way to
  recover the money.
