  The yoga studio in Portsmouth where I spend bitcoin for yoga classes has
  experienced some frustration with the mobile device I gave them, specifically
  that it doesn't hold a charge. Since they already use a desktop computer with
  monitor to sign students in and process credit card payments it makes sense
  that that use that same computer to accept mobile bitcoin payments as well.
