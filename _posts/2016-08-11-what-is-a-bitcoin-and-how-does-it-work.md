  My moment of exam greatness was on an electricity and magnetism final.
  Unfortunately I don't remember the question, but it was to calculate the
  electric field corresponding to some charge distribution given some boundary
  conditions. It's a very straightforward problem, to apply Maxwell's Equations
  and plug away.
