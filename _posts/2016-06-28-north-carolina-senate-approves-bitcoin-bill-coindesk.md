  The North Carolina General Assembly yesterday passed an update to the state's
  Money Transmitters Act, which now mandates that companies working with bitcoin
  and other cryptocurrencies obtain a money transmitter license. The bill
  replaces the current statutory article pertaining to money transmission
  licenses, incorporating much of the existing law and explicitly identifying
  virtual currencies such as bitcoin as subject to the law.
