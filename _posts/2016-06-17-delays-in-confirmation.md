  Bitcoin Stack Exchange is a question and answer site for Bitcoin
  crypto-currency enthusiasts. It's 100% free, no registration required. Sign up
  Here's how it works: Anybody can ask a question Anybody can answer The best
  answers are voted up and rise to the top Some times the network takes a bit
  longer to find a block but that does not seem to be the case right now, since
  there are plenty of blocks found in the last couple of hours?
