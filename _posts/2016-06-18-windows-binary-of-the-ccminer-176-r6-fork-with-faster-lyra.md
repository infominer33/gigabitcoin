  Here comes a updated ccMiner 1.7.6-r6 Widows binary of the Nanashi
  Meiyo-Meijin fork ( source) with optimized Lyra2REv2 performance. The latest
  r6 update might bring a slight performance increase in Lyra2REv2, however it
  significantly increases the performance of the Lyra2RE algorithm based on the
  few tests we ran, results of which you can find below comparing the r5 and r6
  released on different Maxwell GPUs and the new Pascal GTX 1080.
