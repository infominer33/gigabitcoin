  BitFury Group published a whitepaper describing Lightning Network's protocol
  routing as applied to micropayments in Bitcoin network. The proposal is a
  hybrid routing algorithm incorporating two phases: proactive update of routing
  scheme, which stores network topology data; and subsequent active data
  collection if Lightning Network sends a request.
