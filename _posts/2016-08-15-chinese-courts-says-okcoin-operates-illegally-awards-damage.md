  A Chinese court has awarded damages against China's popular bitcoin exchange,
  OKCoin, after it was alleged that the company was aiding criminal money
  laundering and wasn't properly registered. The court decision only affects
  OKCoin's China-based bitcoin exchange, OKCoin.cn, and not its international
  exchange, OKCoin.com; however, it's the first significant ruling by a court
  against a bitcoin exchange.
