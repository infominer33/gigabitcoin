  I was once on a domestic U.S. flight and an 80-year old Italian couple sat
  behind me. While we were at the gate the man asked the stewardess, in very
  broken 'Italianglish' "scusi, where e lavatorio?" (excuse me, where is the
  lavatory?). The stewardess pointed towards the front of the cabin.
