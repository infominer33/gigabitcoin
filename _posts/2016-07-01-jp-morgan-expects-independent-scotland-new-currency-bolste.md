  As a result of the United Kingdom's Brexit vote to leave the European Union,
  American bank JP Morgan/Chase expects that Scotland will leave the UK, and
  will likely adopt its own currency. In a note to clients, JP Morgan economist
  Malcolm Barr indicated that Scotland is likely to hold its own successful
  independence referendum and exit the United Kingdom before the latter's own
  departure from the European Union.
