  Brexit, halving, auctions and exchange problems have dampened demand
  enthusiasm for Bitcoin over the near term. However, a much needed pullback
  might be just what the bulls ordered as we approach Q3 2016. Following what
  was a relatively quick sprint from $430 to $790 over the past month, the
  market is finally taking a much needed breather despite the Brexit drama last
  week.
