  One of the more worrisome side effects of the Brexit is how consumers are
  struggling to buy Pounds Sterling. After the price had dropped to its lowest
  point over 30 years, a lot of people started buying up Pounds en masse.
  Foreign currency providers are feeling the effects, as they have no stock to
  meet customer demand.
