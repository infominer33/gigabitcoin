  I had a contender this afternoon. My 21 year-old's longtime girlfriend is
  doing a dance concert on Sunday. When I told her that I was hoping to attend,
  she thanked me for thinking of her. Me: "But of course. You're family. My
  daughter-in-love." Girlfriend: "Aw, that just made my whole week."
