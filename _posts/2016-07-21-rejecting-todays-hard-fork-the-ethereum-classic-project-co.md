  Ethereum hard forked today. As per what seemed to be the popular demand, the
  protocol rules have been updated incompatibly with the existing Ethereum
  protocol. Users have essentially moved to a new blockchain and left the old
  one behind. At time of publication, well over 90 percent of hash power on the
  Ethereum network had moved to the new chain.
