  Nokia's ringtone composer. The original nokia phones had only monophonic
  ringtones. Almost nobody used the bundled ringtones, especially in India. The
  best thing Nokia did was to include a basic ringtone composer with most of
  their models. The composer was simple to use but you had to have had some form
  of training in western music to make sense of it.
