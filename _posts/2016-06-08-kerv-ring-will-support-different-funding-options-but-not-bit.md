  The Kerv ring has been spurring a lot of debate in the world of contactless
  payments since it was first announced. Albeit there have been some questions
  as to whether or not this product will come to consumers, the release seems
  imminent. A variety of funding methods will be supported, albeit Bitcoin is
  not on that list, unfortunately.
