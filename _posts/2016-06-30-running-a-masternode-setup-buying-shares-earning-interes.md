  With a current return-on-investment of 10-18% annually, many are wondering how
  to launch a Dash masternode. Luckily - unlike in the world of mining -
  detailed information on how to begin is not difficult to come by. But for
  interested investors who don't own 1000 Dash now and won't in the foreseeable
  future, what is a protocol-level, decentralized solution for the long-term?
