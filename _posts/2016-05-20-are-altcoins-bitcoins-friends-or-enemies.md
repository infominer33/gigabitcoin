description: "Altcoins have a long tradition in the Bitcoin community, but they tend to cause a contentious divide among those who think they're useful and those who think they're all scams. One side of the argument, articulated by the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute's Daniel Krawisz, is that altcoins have no chance of success and distract possible users from Bitcoin, while the other side, articulated by many Ethereum supporters, believe platforms such as Bitcoin and Ethereum can work together."
