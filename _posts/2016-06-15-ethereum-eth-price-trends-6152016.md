  Ethereum's price has approached the $20 mark. The long-term upward trend
  continues. How much potential is left in this movement? After exiting the zone
  of a likely medium-term flat of $10-14, Ethereum's price has formed an upward
  trend. The cancellation of a flat has caused the continuation of the long-term
  upward trend.
