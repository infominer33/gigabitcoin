  The editorial board for Bloomberg News has called for a permissive regulatory
  environment for blockchain development, particularly in the area of public
  versions of the technology such as bitcoin. In an editorial published
  yesterday, the board advocated for the use of so-called regulatory sandboxes,
  or rule-making frameworks that allow companies to test financial products
  within a limited scope and customer range.
