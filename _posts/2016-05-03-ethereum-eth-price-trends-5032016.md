description: "Ethereum's price is fortifying at a long-term level. If this keeps up, the turn to growth will become more likely than ever. Ethereum's fortification at a long-term resistance line has indicated that the bulls are holding the advantage. The downward trend is broken and for the upward trend's renewal to become very likely, a turnabout structure has to form."
