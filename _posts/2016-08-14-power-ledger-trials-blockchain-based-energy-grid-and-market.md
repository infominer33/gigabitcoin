  Australian energy startup Power Ledger announced on Thursday that its trials
  have commenced using blockchain technology to "put power in the pockets of
  electricity consumers." People in Perth and across southwest Australia may
  soon have the power to buy, sell or swap excess solar energy with anyone
  connected to the Western Power network, if trials that began yesterday prove
  successful.
