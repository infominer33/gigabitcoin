  Bitcoin Core contributor, Peter Todd, was recently interviewed on Bitcoin
  Uncensored by co-hosts Chris DeRose and Joshua Unseth. Ethereum, The DAO,
  private blockchains and many other topics were discussed but DeRose turned the
  conversation toward an often-discussed concept (at least on Bitcoin
  Uncensored) near the end of the show: The idea that governments essentially
  subsidize the usefulness of Bitcoin and the bitcoin price through their
  various regulations.
