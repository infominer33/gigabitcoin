  Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial has created a private, proof-of-stake
  blockchain that seeks to help make charities more transparent and accountable.
  The news comes just months after Ant Financial closed a $4.5bn private
  fundraising round at a $60bn valuation. Ant Financial was spun out of
  China-based e-commerce giant Alibaba prior to its 2014 IPO, though both are
  overseen by executive chairman Jack Ma.
