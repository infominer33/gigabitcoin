  The price of Bitcoin has dropped quite a bit over the past 24 hours with the
  USD value plummeting to $480 per bitcoin. The price has partially rebounded
  however, hovering around $540 at press time. Meanwhile, much of the blame is
  being pointed at the compromised Hong Kong-based exchange Bitfinex.
