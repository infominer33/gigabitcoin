  WorldCoinIndex reports a 5.17% increase for BTC against the Chinese Yuan, and
  5.75% against the US Dollar. That being said, the biggest gain is coming from
  the EUR market, with a 7.22% increase over the past 24 hours. It is impossible
  to ignore the bullish Bitcoin price trend over the past few weeks.
