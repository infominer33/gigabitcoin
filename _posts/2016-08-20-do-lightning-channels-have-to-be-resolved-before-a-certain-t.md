  I seem to remember that Lightning channels could remain open indefinitely with
  the introduction of CLTV I think instead of "CLTV" you mean "CSV" (as in
  OP_CSV, BIP112). As far as I know, nobody claimed that OP_CLTV would allow
  HLTC-style (Lightning) payment channels to stay open indefinitely, but that
  was definitely a claim of OP_CSV.
