  Antony Lewis is a bitcoin and blockchain consultant, who previously served as
  the director of business development at bitcoin exchange itBit. In this
  article, Lewis attempts to describe two very different uses for blockchain
  technology and why the division of these two functions is increasingly of
  interest to enterprise firms. On Tuesday, 2nd August, I had the privilege of
  attending an event hosted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the
  city-state's central bank and financial services regulator.
