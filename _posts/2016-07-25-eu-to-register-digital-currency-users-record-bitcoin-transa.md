  The European Commission has submitted their plans to create a central database
  of digital currency users. The EU quotes the prevention of terrorist financing
  and money laundering for the reason behind it. The Commission stated that
  virtual currency transfers, including Bitcoin, are not monitored or observed
  by public authorities within the EU and thus, a regulatory framework for
  digital currency platforms must be established.
