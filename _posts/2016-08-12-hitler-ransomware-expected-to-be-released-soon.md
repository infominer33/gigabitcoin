  It has been a while since we saw a new and distributing form of ransomware hit
  the markets. Security researchers recently discovered what is labeled as
  Hitler-ransomware, albeit the software was never fully developed.
  Interestingly enough, the project was known as Hitler-ransonware, and for now,
  it remains unclear is development is still going on behind the scenes.
