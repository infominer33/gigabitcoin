  After losing nearly US$70 million worth of Bitcoin in a sophisticated cyber
  attack, Hong Kong-based exchange Bitfinex is considering spreading the loss
  amongst Bitcoin holders in the exchange. In a blog post on August 5, Bitfinex
  told its users and customers about the possibility of "socialized loss
  scenario," in which active loans to BTC/USD positions and Bitcoin balances may
  be used to settle the theft.
