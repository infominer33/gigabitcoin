  Allianz Risk Transfer AG (ART) and Nephila Capital Limited have successfully
  completed several tests using the blockchain technology to transact a natural
  catastrophe swap. In finance, a catastrophe swap is an instrument traded in
  the over-the-counter market which allows insurers to prevent potential losses
  developed from natural disasters by reinsuring against catastrophic events
  that often occur with high severity.
