  Bitcoin is designed as a peer-to-peer network, where nodes randomly connect to
  other nodes. Transactions and blocks are transmitted over this network by
  these nodes, until each has received all. This works quite well, as the
  distributed model makes Bitcoin relatively censorship-resistant; there is no
  central point of control to shut down or pressure into compliance.
