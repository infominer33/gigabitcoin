  A strong trading volume is keeping the Bitcoin price alive for the time being.
  With an incremental gain in value over the past day, the popular
  cryptocurrency seems to be well underway to hit US$600 at some point.
  Interestingly enough, Huobi keeps dropping down the list of trading platforms,
  as they have now been overtaken by OKCoin once again.
