  The price of classic ether (ETC) has plunged over the past week, as the
  original excitement surrounding the newly created digital currency appears to
  have worn off with investors. The adjustment would appear to have taken some
  of the momentum out of the nascent ethereum classic blockchain, which has
  enjoyed notable price gains and trading volume despite the fact many analysts
  expected it to die of shortly after its unlikely creation.
