  A few days ago, there were some questions as to whether or not Ethereum
  Classic was a real thing. By the look of things, Ethereum Classic is very
  real, as it is now trading on the Poloniex exchange. This alternative
  big-block fork is quite an interesting take on things, and it will affect
  Bitcoin in the long run as well.
