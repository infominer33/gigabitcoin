  Is it time to buy Bitcoin? Has the idea finally come into vogue after nearly
  seven long years? My YouTube video, "How To Buy Bitcoins: In 3 Minutes" is
  already up to 18,412 views (you can watch it here), which is amazing
  considering it was shot in about, well, 3 minutes - quite unprofessionally
  from my garbage fire of a laptop at the time, no less.
