  Andrew Lee, co-founder of Purse, had a common frustration that Bitcoin didn't
  offer any incentive for normal people to use it, and had a hunch that he could
  use blockchain escrows to liquidate Amazon gift cards and deliver great deals.
  That hunch proved to be correct - and transacted over $4.5M and saved users
  almost a million dollars.
