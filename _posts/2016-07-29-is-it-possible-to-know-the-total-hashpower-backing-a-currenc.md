      Peter Randall, one of the founders and former CEO of the alternative
      European stock exchange Chi-X, and Anthony Culligan, founder of
      peer-to-peer bitcoin trading venue Roolo, have announced to launch
      blockchain startup SETL. SETL will introduce a permissioned blockchain
      that is set to run on enterprise level servers and is said to be able to
      handle 100,000 transactions per second.

  There are really two different measurements you have to be concerned with for
  a particular blockchain: The current difficulty (how much hashing power is
  currently going into single blocks) The total chainwork of the blockchain or
  fork of a blockchain The current difficulty is a function of the current
  target.
