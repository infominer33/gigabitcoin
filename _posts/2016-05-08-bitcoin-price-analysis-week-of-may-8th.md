description: "The upward dynamic continues on Bitcoin. If the structure of that movement isn't disrupted, it is likely to grow into a medium-term upward trend. After fortifying at a medium-term resistance line, Bitcoin's price has undergone a turn to growth. The level of $450.5 could've become the peak of a correction preceding a downward trend, but the bears were a minority."
