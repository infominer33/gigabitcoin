  The price of bitcoin continued higher on Saturday, building off its biggest
  rally since 2013 as investors digested Brexit volatility ahead of the planned
  halving of bitcoin mining rewards later this month. The BTC/USD exchange rate
  climbed 2% to $689.00, extending its weekly gain to over 7% as global currency
  markets recoiled from Brexit-induced volatility.
