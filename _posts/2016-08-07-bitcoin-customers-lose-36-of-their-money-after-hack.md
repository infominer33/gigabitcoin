  Hong Kong-based Bitfinex said it's working to reopen the exchange by Monday.
  The platform was shut down on August 3 after 119,756 bitcoins, worth more than
  $65 million based on exchange rates at the time, were stolen from some users'
  accounts. Bitfinex said it decided "after much thought, analysis and
  consultations" to generalize the losses across all users.
