  HempCoin is a Scrypt algorithm coin like Litecoin and countless other Bitcoin
  alternatives, but unlike most, it has a publicly traded company, Rocky
  Mountain Ayre, backing it. Interest seems to be increasing in the coin, which
  is one of the many currencies targeting marijuana dispensaries and other legal
  marijuana entities which have banking issues due to federal regulations in the
  United States.
