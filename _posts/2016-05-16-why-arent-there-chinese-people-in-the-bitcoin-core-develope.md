description: "I'd avoid both. A decent knife, say, this: Is no joke. It can penetrate sufficiently to destroy vital organs and has the size and strength to cause a LOT of damage. The advantage of a bullet is not so much in it's individual killing power, but rather in the fact that it can be employed with relatively minimal training, by people who are not exceptionally strong, at a distance."
