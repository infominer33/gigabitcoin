  The digital currency markets repeatedly remind us of a tired but true maxim:
  your money is only as secure as the bank that guards it. After a recent hack
  resulted in the theft of $70 million worth of bitcoin, Hong Kong-based
  Bitfinex caused a minor panic when it announced it would spread the losses
  equally among all its customers, even those whose holdings weren't touched.
