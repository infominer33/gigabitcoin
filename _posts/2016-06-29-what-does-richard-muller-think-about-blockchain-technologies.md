  "Market forces" are an extremely poor basis for social or moral
  decision-making. There is a market for child prostitutes. That doesn't mean we
  allow it. There is a market for slaves. And in bad economic times, there is a
  market for people who will work for starvation wages, especially in a country
  with as poor a safety net as the USA's.
