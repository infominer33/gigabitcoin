  Experimental male contraceptive project Vasalgel received a Bitcoin donation
  valued at $13,000 last month. Unfortunately, the donation was declined and
  sent back by Vasalgel's payment processor. Via a Facebook post, Vasalgel
  announced the failed donation and pleaded with the would-be donor to repeat
  the attempt: "OMG, someone just tried to donate $13,000 of Bitcoins to support
  Vasalgel development, but it was declined because it's over the $10,000 daily
  limit!
