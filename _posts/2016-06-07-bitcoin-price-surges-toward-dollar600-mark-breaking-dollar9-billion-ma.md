  The world's most valuable cryptocurrency bitcoin is surging once again, this
  time toward the $600 mark, a price it has not reached since early August 2014
  when the digital currency's value was in freefall. The exact reason for the
  price rise is unclear, but the continuing uncertainty over the Chinese yuan is
  thought by many to be pushing the price of bitcoin higher.
