  Keywords/phrases: Privacy and transparency. Financial privacy has been the
  norm. Law enforcement has never had full access or visibility into our
  finances. Most law enforcement still use traditional mechanisms. We don't have
  to give away privacy to be safe. Privacy is not the antithesis of security;
  privacy is security.
