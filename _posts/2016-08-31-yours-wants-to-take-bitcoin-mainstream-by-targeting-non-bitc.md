  Former Reddit Cryptocurrency Engineer, Ryan X. Charles, is currently working
  on a new, bitcoin-powered social network, but he isn't focused on creating
  something that will only be used by the Bitcoin community. In a recent
  interview on Epicenter Bitcoin, Charles noted that creating an app used by a
  mainstream audience would have much more value than simply creating /r/Bitcoin
  with micropayments.
