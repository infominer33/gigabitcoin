  2016 has become a year of revival for the bitcoin price. At a press time total
  of $640, the price of bitcoin is up nearly 50% from its opening on 1st

  have arguably played a role, there may be no bigger influence that the
  upcoming halving, a rare network event that will happen this weekend.
