      On "Hannity" tonight, Donald Trump said he's disappointed with our
      country's leaders, particularly President Obama, who he called the worst
      president in the history of the U.S. Trump said that Obama has been a
      disaster for the country, pointing to the nuclear agreement with Iran as a
      recent example of the president's failures.

  Of course not. That's readily apparent. While Trump lies almost constantly I
  don't think he's a malicious liar. He just wants to keep the party going.
  However this is a man who stiffs his contractors and lies about almost
  everything such as his charitable donations and net worth.
