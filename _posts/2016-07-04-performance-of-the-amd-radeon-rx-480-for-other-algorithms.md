  We have already covered the performance of the new AMD Radeon RX 480 GPUs for
  mining Ethereum, so it is time to see how the GPU performs with other popular
  algorithms. We have already mentioned that the RX 480 apparently has some
  issues running sgminer (at least under Windows), so we were not able to run
  tests with many of the currently popular algorithms, but it seems that many
  people missed that part.
