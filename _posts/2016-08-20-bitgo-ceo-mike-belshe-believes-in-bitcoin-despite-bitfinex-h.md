  BitGo's Mike Belshe has said that questions raised about the security of
  bitcoin with some suggesting that digital currencies can never be secure are
  wrong. After Mt. Gox, the second biggest security breach of a bitcoin exchange
  took place earlier this month when the Hong Kong-based Bitfinex halted trading
  after hackers stole around $70 million worth of users' bitcoins.
