  Bitcoin's transaction value has increased drastically over the past year,
  mostly because of both political and economic instability we've been
  witnessing in the past few years, according to a new Juniper Research report.
  Total value of the cryptocurrency's transactions is expected to hit $92
  billion (£69.3bn) this year, up from less than $27 billion in 2015.
