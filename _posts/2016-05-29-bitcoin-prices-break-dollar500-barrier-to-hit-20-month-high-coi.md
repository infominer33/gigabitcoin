description: "Bitcoin prices broke through $500 on 28th May, building on the prior day's climb to reach a level not seen since August 2014. The sharp increase helped extend the currency's recent rally, which has provided a notable contrast to the relative stability bitcoin experienced in the last several weeks and for much of the first half of 2016."
