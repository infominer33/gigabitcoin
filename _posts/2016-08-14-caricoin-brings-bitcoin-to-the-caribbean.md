  One of the most interesting trends in Bitcoin's development has been that it
  seems to thrive in struggling economies or, more specifically, economies in
  which people have limited access to bank accounts. This first became apparent
  in Greece, where a decade-long financial crisis has recently led some citizens
  to go about adopting cryptocurrency as a primary means of storing and
  transferring funds.
