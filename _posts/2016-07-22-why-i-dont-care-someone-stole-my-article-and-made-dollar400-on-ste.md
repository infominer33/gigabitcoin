  Someone told my CCN post and published it on Steemit. They earned $400
  [Editor's note: The payout did not occur after the article was found to be
  plagiarized]. I earned substantially less. Why don't I care? Because I am
  realistic about the nature of the Internet, the economy - and most
  importantly, Bitcoiners.
