  Ask any American woman whether their freedom, e.g., to drive, is "simply an
  illusion" compared to Saudi Arabia, where the punishment for this would be
  lashing. Ask a gay American, who is free to marry, whether this freedom is an
  illusion compared to nations where being gay is a capital crime, where he
  might be flung off a tall building.
