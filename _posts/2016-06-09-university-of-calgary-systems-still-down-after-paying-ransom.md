  Paying the fee associated with a ransomware should always be seen as a last
  resort. There is no guarantee the decryption keys will restore full system
  access or revert all data back to its original state. The University of
  Calgary is the most recent victim of ransomware attacks, and the school paid
  CND$20,000 in Bitcoin to get rid of the malware.
