      In its relative short history, bitcoin - and its underlying technology the
      blockchain - have captivated thinkers around the world, but not everyone
      was quick to see the potential. Due in part to its initial billing as a
      threat to the traditional financial ecosystem, these institutions have
      perhaps understandably responded with sharp critiques and deep skepticism
      for the technology.

  Blockchain app development startup BlockCypher has expanded its platform to
  include support for Ethereum, a move the company says will see professional
  services firm Deloitte among its first users. BlockCypher CEO and co-founder
  Catheryne Nicholson says the addition of Ethereum was in response to an
  increased demand from more than half of the startup's client base, which also
  counts remittance app startup Abra among those using the new toolset.
