  In a transcript of a cancelled speech released online today, Bank of England
  Governor Mark Carney cited a "central bank digital currency" as a development
  that could result from its ongoing distributed ledger proof-of-concepts. The
  remarks come as global central banks begin to experiment openly with
  distributed ledgers, a technology inspired by the decentralized, public
  ledgers used to run cryptocurrencies.
