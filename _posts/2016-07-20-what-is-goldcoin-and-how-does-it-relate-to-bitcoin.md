  Goldcoin (GLD) is a cryptocurrency built using the original bitcoin protocol.
  It's part of the class commonly known today as alternative currencies. It
  currently holds the top position on both Google and Amazon. Unhappy with the

  Goldcoin decided that, rather than complain about it, they would tackle the
  job themselves and complete the original vision.
