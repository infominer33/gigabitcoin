  When hackers penetrated a secure authentication system at a bitcoin exchange
  called Bitfinex earlier this month, they stole about $70 million worth of the
  virtual currency. The cyber theft-the second largest by an exchange since
  hackers took roughly $350 million in bitcoins at Tokyo's MtGox exchange in
  early 2014-is hardly a rare occurrence in the emerging world of
  crypto-currencies.
