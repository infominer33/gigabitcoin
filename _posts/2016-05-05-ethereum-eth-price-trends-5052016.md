description: "Ethereum has stopped at the top limit of the flat. Such an advantage on the side of the bulls could provoke an upward impulse. The fortification alone is not enough, as a false breakthrough can happen and Ethereum's price will drop sharply as a result, at least down to the bottom limit of the flat."
