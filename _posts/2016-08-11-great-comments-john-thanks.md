  Great comments John, thanks. All valid points. I wouldn't consider this
  article an exhaustive analysis of the incentives and the impact of segwit, so
  thanks for offering additional analysis. I especially appreciate the input
  about rewarding full nodes, something that other chains have incorporated in
  their design and could potentially be a useful addition for a future upgrade
  of bitcoin.
