  Here's what we are looking at as we head a fresh day's trading in the bitcoin
  price market. Across pretty much the entirety of yesterday's session in the
  bitcoin price, we saw an upside run. Marred by the odd correction, this run
  brought price to trade at what amounted to fresh weekly highs just ahead of
  665, shortly before the day drew to a close.
