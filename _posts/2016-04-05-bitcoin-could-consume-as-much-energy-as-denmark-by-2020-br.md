description: "Analysts are calling the cryptocurrency's current consumption of energy unsustainable and suggesting that if the currency is to survive, it will have to adopt new energy-efficient technology. Researcher Sebastiaan Deetman came to the conclusion that at bitcoin's current level of expansion, it will require 14 gigawatts of electricity to run by the year 2020 - an amount of energy equivalent to that of a small country, like Denmark."
