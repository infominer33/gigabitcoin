  Every country needs US dollars if it wants to buy crude oil. This may soon
  change as a market selling crude oil for Bitcoin has emerged. The term
  'petrodollar' has been thrown around since the 1970s. Dollars for oil have
  been the principal source of earning for many oil producing nations in the
  Middle East, as well as in other parts of the world.
