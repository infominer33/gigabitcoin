  crypto-currency enthusiasts. It's 100% free, no registration required. Sign up
  Here's how it works: Anybody can ask a question Anybody can answer The best
  answers are voted up and rise to the top You are looking at a Bitcoin miner,
  not the Litecoin miner which you need for Scrypt hashing so the estimates will
  not even be close.
