  Powered by the IPFS technology and the Graphene Blockchain, Echo aims to
  deliver a full-feature decentralized chatting app. It is everything you'd
  expect from a regular messenger: free and easy to use, but also secure,
  private and encrypted. The project is still in development, with 4
  proof-of-concept versions already released, and a Kickstarter campaign in
  preparation.
