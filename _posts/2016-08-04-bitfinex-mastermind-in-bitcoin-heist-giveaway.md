  An individual claiming to be behind the recent Bitfinex (BFX) hack has
  announced the giveaway of 1,000 bitcoins, prompting those within the online
  community that this could be a money laundering scheme. Earlier this week, the
  Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange revealed that it had suffered a major
  security breach after 119,756 bitcoins, amounting to around $65 million, had
  been stolen forcing a shutdown of its website and trading.
