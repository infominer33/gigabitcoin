      Servers.com, a hosting company with a focus on dedicated bare-metal
      servers that launched in Europe in 2005, today announced the opening of
      its first U.S. data center location. The new Dallas data center currently
      only offers dedicated servers, but it will soon also play host to
      Servers.com's shared cloud hosting servers.

  Using the Internet is a right, or a privilege, that many people take for
  granted. Many apps, social networks, and search engines collect user data and
  have proceeded to centralize the Internet over time, without much notice by
  the masses. The tracking of user's IP address and location information is now
  just a part of the online tapestry.
