  Bitcoin.org has warned users to be aware that the upcoming release of Bitcoin
  Core is likely to be targeted by state-sponsored cyberattackers. The group
  which manages Bitcoin Core, the client used to keep the virtual currency
  decentralized while at the same time aims to accept only valid transactions,
  warned this week that the organization has "reason to suspect" that the
  binaries used in the next release will become targets.
