      blockchain - have captivated thinkers around the world, but not everyone
      was quick to see the potential. Due in part to its initial billing as a

      perhaps understandably responded with sharp critiques and deep skepticism
      for the technology.

  digital good. This view owes itself in no large part to the blockchain, the
  distributed database that secures units of the digital currency by allowing
  users to add and verify transactions without a third-party.
