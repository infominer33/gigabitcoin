  Jakarta: Australia is moving to become one of the first countries to regulate
  e-currencies such as bitcoin under its anti-money laundering and
  counter-terrorism financing laws. Bitcoin - the most prominent digital
  currency to emerge globally - is backed by a computer code rather than a
  physical substance such as gold or mainstream currency.
