  A number of people are testing segwit + [BIP 152][] on testnet. There's no PR
  for this yet as this allows for testing interactions with non-segwit-BIP152
  and it needs some BIP changes (in BIP144, [BIP 152][] or a separate BIP). It
  would be good to have it in before the activation of segwit, as otherwise
  compact blocks will suddenly disable.
