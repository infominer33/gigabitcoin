  Arizona State University researchers created a way that makes gathering data
  from dark net markets and forums easy, and it helps identify new emerging
  cyber threats as they come out. The system uses search engines and dark net
  sites through the Tor network, and the researchers say they have found almost
  30 marketplaces, and over 20 forums that black hat hackers are calling home.
