  Philippine Bitcoin fintech startup Satoshi Citadel Industries (SCI) has
  acquired bitcoin investment app Keza for an undisclosed sum. Founded in 2015,
  Keza allowed bitcoin users to invest in bitcoin or fixed income stocks in the
  United States or other international stock exchanges via a mobile app; the app
  allowed users to invest in three types of trading - modest, conservative and
  aggressive - allowing users to choose their level of exposure to volatile
  assets and keep tabs on risk to their capital.
