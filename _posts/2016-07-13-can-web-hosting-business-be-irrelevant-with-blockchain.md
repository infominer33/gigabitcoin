  When I first moved to the US in the 90's I travelled a lot from Silicon Valley
  to Florida for a project I was working on. I thought it was so cool how you
  could just jump on a 5-hour flight with just a driving license and that you
  could turn up just before the plane took off (it was so easy before 9/11).
