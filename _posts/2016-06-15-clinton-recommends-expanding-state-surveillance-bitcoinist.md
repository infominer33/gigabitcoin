  Hillary Clinton has come out in support of extending the surveillance state in
  response to the Orlando Mass Shooting in a recent interview with NPR. Her
  Proposals include a dedicated task force applied to preventing
  "self-radicalization," more "integrated intelligence use" among the different
  levels of law enforcement, working with silicon valley to "prevent online
  radicalization" and broadening the scope of federal watch lists, gun control
  related databases, and surveillance.
