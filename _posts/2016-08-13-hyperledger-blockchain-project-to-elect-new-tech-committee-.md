  Election season has begun for the Hyperledger project, the open-source, Linux
  Foundation-led blockchain initiative. The project is preparing to elect a new
  technical steering committee (TSC) as well as a new chairperson for that
  committee this month, a move that comes less than a year after the Hyperledger
  project publicly launched in December of 2015 as a way to create a "business
  blockchain" for use by enterprises.
