  Gold is so last millennium. When traders were under the false impression that
  Britain's "remain" campaign had the upper hand, it was Bitcoin, not the
  barbarous relic, that really took it on the chin. The popular State Street
  SPDR exchange traded fund, which goes by the GLD ticker symbol, slumped on
  Thursday to its lowest in nearly three weeks.
