  Blocksafe, a secure access Blockchain-based system, is about to build its
  Blockchain using Lisk sidechain technology. This Blockchain is said to issue a
  new token for use on the chain called "Trigger" (TRIG). It will work with a
  planned array of smart gun technologies such as magazines, locks and other
  Trigger-enabled hardware including the third-party and user-created hardware
  which can be 3D printed or manufactured.
