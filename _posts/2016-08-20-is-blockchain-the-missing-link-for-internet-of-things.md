  Economies spend a lot of money on infrastructure. Yet a lot of this
  infrastructure lies idle and is underutilised. Big industrial machinery,
  medical equipment and even ports and airports are mostly unused and not used
  to their fullest potential. What if we were to find a way which would allow us
  to use our assets to their fullest capacity?
