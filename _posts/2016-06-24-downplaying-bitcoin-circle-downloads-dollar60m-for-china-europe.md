  Circle Internet Financial aims to make transferring money to a friend across
  town or on the other side of the world as easy as sending a text message. That
  plan got a big boost with Wednesday's announcement of a $60 million windfall
  from mostly Chinese investors and the formation of a Beijing-based venture
  that will work to bring Circle's mobile payments service to the world's most
  populous country.
