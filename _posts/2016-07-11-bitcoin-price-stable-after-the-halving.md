  The reduction in half of the rewards given to miners for securing the Bitcoin
  Blockchain Network, brought to the table several speculations and uncertainty
  about the price of bitcoin and its stability, however, today, the price of
  bitcoin remains apparently stable, at a rate of around 650$, demonstrating
  that those who stated that the Halving is a normal and scheduled process, and
  as such, would not have any important impact on Bitcoin's pricing and market
  itself, were right.
