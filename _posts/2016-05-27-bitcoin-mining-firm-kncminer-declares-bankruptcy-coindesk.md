description: "Sweden-based bitcoin mining firm KnCMiner, a startup that has raised $29m in venture funding from investors including Accel and Creandum, has declared bankruptcy. Once one of the industry's fastest-growing mining firms, the bankruptcy filing and entrance into receivership marks a new and perhaps penultimate phase for KnC, which was founded in 2013 and has drawn fire in the past from bitcoin and digital currency ecosystem over its consumer-oriented mining products."
