description: "The technical setups posted below use simple trend detection, support and resistance, channels, pattern and candle analysis. We aim for high-probability trade setups on BTCUSD and use very few indicators. All charts use BNC's Bitcoin Liquid Index for maximum accuracy. The timeframe for trades is 1 to 7 days, so we'll use 4h candlesticks."
