  The Cornell computer scientist who helped identify vulnerabilities in The DAO
  revealed 10 new exploits in its code at an event in New York. The statements
  from Emin Gün Sirer, a longstanding critic of the project, come amid broad
  concern over developments at The DAO, a smart contract-based funding vehicle
  built with ethereum that has effectively collapsed following an exploit of a
  vulnerability within its smart contract code.
