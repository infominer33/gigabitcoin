  Malware continues to create financial losses all over the world. Criminals are
  targeting computer users, but also point-of-sale devices and ATms. A new ATM
  heist in Thailand saw 12 million baht being stolen. As a result, the central
  bank of Thailand was forced to shut down nearly half of its ATMs. For now,
  preliminary investigations seem to indicate an Eastern European gang is
  responsible for these attacks.
