  Ethereum is in an uptrend across all the main exchanges once again. After
  facing a lot of scrutiny over what happened to The DAO, it seems things have
  calmed down a bit. What happened to the biggest crowdfunding project in
  history is unfortunate, but it does not necessarily reduce their trust people
  have put in Ethereum.
