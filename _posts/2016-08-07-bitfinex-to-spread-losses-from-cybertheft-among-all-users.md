  Bitfinex, the digital-currency exchange that lost $65 million to hackers last
  week, plans to spread the losses among all its users, including those not
  directly impacted by the hack. The Hong Kong-based digital-currency exchange
  said in a statement Sunday that the losses from the theft would be shared, or
  "generalized across all accounts and assets" of its clients, with each taking
  a loss of around 36%.
