  Bitcoin block #415,000 was just mined, marking just 5,000 blocks left until
  block #420,000 - the point at which the mining reward will drop from it's
  current bounty of 25 brand new bitcoin immediately down to 12.5. The first
  bitcoin block, the so called "Genesis Block", was mined on January 3, 2009,
  marking the beginning of the bitcoin "blockchain".
