  A post on reddit has bee published today that introduces Classic Ethereum
  (CETH) - another Ethereum (ETH) for that is apparently in the making at the
  moment. Just like Ethereum Classic (ETC) the new Classic Ethereum (CETH) fork
  will follow the original Ethereum blockchain until the controversial block
  1920000 where it will fork with a small signature change to make replay
  attacks impossible.
