  Russia has joined the bitcoin age with the country seeing the opening of its
  first bitcoin exchange despite ongoing attempts in the country to ban the
  trade of cryptocurrencies. The exchange, run by a group well-known as
  BTC24pro.com on LocalBitcoins, is a physical office that allows customers to
  convert bitcoin into Russian Rubbles but does not allow the purchase of
  bitcoin itself.
