  Don't be alarmed by the current slump in the bitcoin price. In fact, there is
  still cause for optimism. The market is going through a reversal pattern to
  the $700 level, where a congestion area should reinforce quotes for another
  climb to $820, keeping us right on track to hit the projections advanced last
  week.
