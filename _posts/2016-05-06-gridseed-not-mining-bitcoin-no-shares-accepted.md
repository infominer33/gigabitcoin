    description: "Still, tech news site SiliconAngle reported that Tyson himself may have been \"suckered into a deal by a fast talker who has promised him millions if he gets involved and lends his name to the enterprise.\" It cited MikeTysonBitcoin.com's registration to a Peter Klamka, who is connected to Bitcoin Brands-a firm with a paltry $6,780 market cap according to Google Finance."

description: "So I have had my Gridseed (5 chips) for about a week now, and still couldn't mine any Bitcoin, only Scrypt. I am currently only able to mine with minerd, using Scrypt, and I am on a Mac. I tried to mine Bitcoin using cgminer, bfgminer, minerd (versions from MacMiner and others on the internet), tried to compile, nothings seems to work."
