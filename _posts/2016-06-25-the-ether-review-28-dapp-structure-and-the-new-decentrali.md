  This episode features two interviews. First, Karl Floersch discusses the
  underlying structures which shape distributed applications. Karl's ability to
  explain the deeper mechanics of software running in the Ethereum environment
  is unique and discussions with him are always fun, insightful, and visionary.
  Then we have Manfred Karrer, the creator of Bitsquare.
