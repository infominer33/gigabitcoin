  The price of bitcoin has plunged almost 25 percent since hitting a
  two-and-a-half year high last week amid problems at a key exchange and
  diminishing fears of a Brexit. Bitcoin was trading around $590.53 by midday
  London time, a fall of around 23.8 percent from the $774.94 close on June 17,
  which marked the highest close since November 22, 2013.
