  I don't know anything about Multichain so I'm not sure if this is the answer
  you're looking for, but here's one answer that might help you. The interesting
  thing about proof-of-work (Nakamoto) blockchains is that they enable a
  constantly-changing set of unknown nodes on the internet to achieve consensus
  under certain assumptions about the adversary (i.e., the good guys are more
  "powerful" than the bad guys).
