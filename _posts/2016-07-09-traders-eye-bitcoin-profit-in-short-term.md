  MORE than 80 percent of Bitcoin traders in China, the world's biggest Bitcoin
  trading market, pursue profit through short-term trading of the digital money,
  an industry report said yesterday. The price of Bitcoin, a form of digital
  currency created and held electronically, surged 50 percent in recent months
  to a two-year high in June due to booming Chinese investment and a cut in
  supply starting from today, industry officials said.
