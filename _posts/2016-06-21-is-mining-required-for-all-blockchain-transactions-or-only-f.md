  A lifestyle that promotes purity, modesty, piety, freedom, community and
  related virtues has been a thing since antiquity. I don't think it ever goes
  away, though certainly the issues that are emphasized in public debate will
  vary over time. The core part that remains is the part you don't hear about in
  the news, because it is not controversial.
