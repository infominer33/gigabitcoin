  A Miami judge ruled Monday that Bitcoin is not really money in a
  closely-watched decision that dismissed charges against a local man for
  illegally selling and laundering the virtual currency. Miami-Dade Circuit
  Court Judge Teresa Mary Pooler said that Bitcoin coin was not "tangible
  wealth" and "cannot be hidden under a mattress like cash and gold bars,"
  according to the Miami Herald.
