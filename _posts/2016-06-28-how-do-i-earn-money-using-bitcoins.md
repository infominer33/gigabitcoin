  From above, it looks like the landing site of an enormous UFO.. ​ What is it?
  The Mir Diamond Mine. Location: Siberia, Russian Federation. Why it's cool?
  Because it's the world's largest open-pit kimberlite diamond mine. Discovered
  and built in 1957 by the USSR at 525 m deep and 1,200 m wide, this hole is too
  large it creates its own weather.
