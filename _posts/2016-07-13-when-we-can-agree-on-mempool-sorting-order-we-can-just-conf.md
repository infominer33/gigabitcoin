  When we can agree on a mempool sorting order, we can just confirm first
  n-transactions (or 80% of transactions) that are at least 10 minutes old.
  Then, we can transfer (broadcast) the block header and a hash to the set of
  all confirmed transactions. Just consider this as an aggressive version of
  BIP152, compact blocks.

  When we can agree on mempool sorting order, we can just confirm first
