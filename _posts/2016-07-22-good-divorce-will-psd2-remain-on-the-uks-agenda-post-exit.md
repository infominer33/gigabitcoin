  The UK's vote to leave the EU not only raised many doubts about London's
  continued reign as the global fintech leader, but also certain concerns about
  the country's continued regulatory alignment. However, as the main driver for
  PSD2 is technological and not political, the UK decision to follow a
  development path independently from the EU will hardly have any significant
  effect on the implementation of the directive.
