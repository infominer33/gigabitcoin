  Distributed ledger startup Nuco has inked its first formal partnership since
  being spun out from Deloitte's FinTech team earlier this year. The deal with
  Terepac Corporation has resulted in what the companies are calling the
  "Terepac Blockchain", a distributed ledger designed to allow manufacturers to
  follow the entire life-cycle of their products, as part of what is known as
  the Internet of Things ( IoT).
