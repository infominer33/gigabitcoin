      A new service is offering bitcoin users an answer to the common question:
      what is the optimum transaction fee? Using network data from the past
      three hours, CoinTape lets users compare the current waiting times
      associated with various fee tiers, calculated in satoshis per byte. It
      claims to predict delays with 90% confidence.
