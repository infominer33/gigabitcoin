  French airplane manufacturer Airbus has joined the Hyperledger Project, the
  Linux Foundation-led blockchain initiative begun earlier this year. The
  Toulouse-based manufacturer, which last year beat Boeing to sell more than
  1,000 aircraft, is expected to "actively contribute" to the initiative, which
  also counts companies such as IBM, Intel and JPMorgan among its membership.
