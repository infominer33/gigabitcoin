  I had a website which allowed me to send and receive bitcoins. To achieve
  this, I used the Blockchain API to process notifications of received bitcoins
  and the same to process sending Bitcoin to other addresses. Due to the fact
  that Blockchain forced me to change my calling method because they changed the
  API using node.js I was considering to move away from them.
