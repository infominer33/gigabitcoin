  The price of the digital currency bitcoin hit a two-year high Monday, trading
  above $700 for the first time since 2014, after it jumped 21% over the
  weekend. The surge came days before an unusual event called the "halving," an
  adjustment to bitcoin's protocol designed to control the creation of new
  coins.
