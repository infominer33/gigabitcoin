  For nearly a week now, everyone assumed HashOcean had disappeared all of a
  sudden. But the support team's Facebook page seems to tell a different story.
  They claim a hacker collective by the name of "Prabl0Dynamic HK" hacked the
  site. The domain is still down, and the company has started refunding
  investments from June 26 onwards.
