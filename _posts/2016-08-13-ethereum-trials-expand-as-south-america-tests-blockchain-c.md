  Argentinian wine and Brazilian timber are just the latest products being
  transformed by entrepreneurs building distributed applications on the ethereum
  blockchain in South America. One of Brazil's largest banks recently built a
  smart contract designed to automate parts of the process by which a company
  goes public; a group in Chile is working to help scale the blockchain using
  the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS); and a team in Nicaragua is building a
  secure identity system.
