  Rey on Tatooine would put an irrevocable link between her location and Luke's
  machinations. If he didn't deposit her there, fans would be annoyed at that
  particular violation of misdirection. The script writers would be trapped
  between a mynock and a hot place in the sun. Jakku might have a very specific
  purpose.
