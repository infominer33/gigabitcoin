  The fundamental assumption of any blockchain, whether public or private, is
  that 51% of actors are honest. For this assumption to hold, there must be
  decentralization (a sufficiently large number of individual/entity actors to
  such extent that exercising direct influence on 51% of actors is unfeasible)
  in four key aspects: developers, miners/stakers, exchanges/businesses, and
  media platforms. To place weight on their influence is difficult due to the
  balance of power between these four fundamental pillars.
