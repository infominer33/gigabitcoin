  The National People's Congress, the national legislature of China, has
  released draft text for a civil law code that, if implemented, would provide a
  legal definition for virtual property. Following the announcement yesterday,
  reports began emerging that the definition could extend to blockchain-based
  assets including bitcoin and other digital currencies, with such speculation
  being set off by communications from ChinaLedger, a China-based blockchain
  consortium.
