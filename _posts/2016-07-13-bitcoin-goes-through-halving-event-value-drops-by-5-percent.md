  Digital cryptocurrency Bitcoin has undergone its "halving" event which happens
  every four years or after every 210,000 blocks of transactions. This event,
  according to a law in its rulebook, cuts in half the value of the digital
  payout that the 'miners' receive for supporting the network by providing
  computing resources.
