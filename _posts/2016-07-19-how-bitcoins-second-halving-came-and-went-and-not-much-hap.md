  Bitcoin's block reward halved for the second time last week, from 25 to 12.5
  bitcoins. The event, commonly referred to as "the halving" (or sometimes: "the
  halvening"), was a key moment in Bitcoin's history. Such halvings are
  scheduled to occur once in about every four years, and they ensure that no
  more than 21 million bitcoins will ever be in circulation.
