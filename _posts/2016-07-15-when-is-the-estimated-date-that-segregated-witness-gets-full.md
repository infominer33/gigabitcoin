  Bitcoin Stack Exchange is a question and answer site for Bitcoin
  crypto-currency enthusiasts. It's 100% free, no registration required. Sign up
  Here's how it works: Anybody can ask a question Anybody can answer The best
  answers are voted up and rise to the top I read the news recently that reviews
  had already been done and that the segregated witness program will be on
  deployment soon, so when is it expected to be fully adapted worldwide?
