title: "REPOST from 12/2015: \"If there are only 20 seats on the bus and 25 people that want to ride, there is no ticket price where everyone gets a seat. Capacity problems can't be fixed with a 'fee market'; they are fixed by adding seats, which in this case means raising the blocksize cap.\" - /u/Vibr8gKiwi * /r/btc"
