  A little more than two years after the Internal Revenue Service issued
  bare-bones guidance on bitcoin and other digital currencies, the agency still
  hasn't addressed many important tax matters affecting them. The American
  Institute of CPAs sent the IRS a letter earlier this month requesting
  clarifications on 10 issues, including the tax status of small transactions
  and rules for donating digital currencies to charity.
