  In the wildest of claims, bitcoin - the virtual paperless and stateless
  currency transacted on the borderless internet - was going to tear apart
  traditional money transfer companies and help alleviate poverty. Accessing the
  multibillion-dollar remittance flows to Africa certainly has substantial
  appeal, perhaps helping to attract some large seed investments in African
  bitcoin startups.
