  Peer-to-peer marketplaces are forcing change on the systems we use for dispute
  resolution. Algorithmic dispute resolution, software-guided settlement
  negotiation, and even full-service stepped mediation to arbitration online
  dispute resolution (ODR) projects all existed in 2002-2003. Yet despite the
  promise of lower costs, faster speed, and jurisdictional autonomy, most of
  those projects have long been abandoned.
