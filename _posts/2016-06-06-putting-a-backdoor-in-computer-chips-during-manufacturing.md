  Researchers have provided the world with some very worrying finding, as it is
  possible to build a backdoor in computer chips. To make matters even worse, it
  would be nearly impossible to detect such a backdoor. Albeit this is only a
  proof-of-concept for the time being, it goes to show the technology we use can
  be tampered with in many different ways.
