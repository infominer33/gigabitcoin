  A US judge largely denied a bid last week by Mizuho Bank to dismiss charges
  filed against it in a class action lawsuit tied to the collapse of defunct
  bitcoin exchange Mt Gox. In a court order dated 26th August, US District Judge
  Gary Feinerman ruled Mizhuo should face charges related to unjust enrichment
  and fraudulent concealment in connection with the exchange's failure.
