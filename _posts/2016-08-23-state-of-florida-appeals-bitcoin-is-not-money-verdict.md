  A local Florida Bitcoin seller recently saw all charges against him dismissed
  by a judge. That seemed rather strange, considering Michell Espinoza was under
  investigation for money laundering and unlicensed money transmission. However,
  the judge ruled. Bitcoin is not money. The state of Florida is now appealing
  that decision, and this case will drag on for quite some time.
