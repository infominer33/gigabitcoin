  Urbit, the computing platform described as a "city in the cloud" by its
  inventors, raised more than $200,000 in four hours through a crowdsale last
  week. While the crypto-space has seen many spectacular crowd-sales, some more
  dodgy than others, Urbit has been able to excite leading venture capitalists
  and executives in the space, including BitGo's Ben Davenport, 21 Inc.'s Balaji
  Srinivasan and Chaincode Labs' Alex Morcos.
