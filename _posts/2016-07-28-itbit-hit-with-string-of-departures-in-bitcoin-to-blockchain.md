      In its relative short history, bitcoin - and its underlying technology the
      blockchain - have captivated thinkers around the world, but not everyone
      was quick to see the potential. Due in part to its initial billing as a
      threat to the traditional financial ecosystem, these institutions have
      perhaps understandably responded with sharp critiques and deep skepticism
      for the technology.

  A series of recent departures at itBit have left the company looking much
  different than it did just a few months ago. Following the release of itBit's
  enterprise clearing and settlement network Bankchain last year, three
  directors (and at least three other employees) have gone on to other
  endeavors.
