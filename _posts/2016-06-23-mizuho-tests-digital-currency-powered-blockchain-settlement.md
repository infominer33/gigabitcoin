  Mizuho Financial Group announced today that it has tested the use of a token,
  or digital currency-based, blockchain settlement system. While little is known
  about the test (beyond its description), it is notable given the emphasis
  financial incumbents have placed on using distributed ledger solutions for
  settlement in which information, not any finite digital asset, is shared among
  participants.
