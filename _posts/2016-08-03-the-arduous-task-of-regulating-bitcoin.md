  Regulatory uncertainty will continue to inhibit the widespread adoption of
  cryptocurrencies. Though the U.S. federal government has made progress in
  regulating cryptocurrencies, uncertainty and ambiguity at the state level will
  be more difficult to overcome. Blockchain, the technology underpinning
  cryptocurrencies, will have a greater impact than the cryptocurrencies derived
  from it.
