description: 'The 0.000105 pivot area continues to be a dominant price level on the MAIDsafe charts. On the 14th, 0.000105 acted as support for a third time. Since bouncing off 0.00015, price has been rallying and is now approaching another major pivot area that may cause some problems: 0.000128, which was outlined in two of my previous MAIDsafe articles ( 05/09/2016 & 05/04/2016).'
