  In a system of two bodies, one does not truly orbit the other. They both orbit
  about the barycenter between them. Here's an example of two identically massed
  bodies. They orbit around the red x. In the case of a solar system, the star
  is so much more massive than the planet that the barycenter is usually within
  the star.
