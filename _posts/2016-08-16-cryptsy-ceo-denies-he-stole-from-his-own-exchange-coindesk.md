  Cryptsy CEO Paul Vernon has fired back at allegations he moved millions of
  dollars in funds from the now-defunct digital currency exchange to personal
  accounts. In new statements, Vernon told CoinDesk that the finding, issued by
  the court-appointed receiver earlier this month, is "misleading", arguing
  instead that the contested money movements came as a result of mingling
  business and personal accounts.
