  Ethereum is a platform for decentralized and truthful applications that run on
  a global, peer-to-peer network without any administrators or a single point of
  failure. These applications have zero downtime and anyone can create them: it
  is permissionless innovation. The applications are truthful, immutable and
  always interoperate as they are coded.
