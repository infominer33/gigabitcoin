  Compact Blocks stole XThin's ID #: "When Bitcoin Core used the same ID # for
  their Compact Block that was already being used by the XThin block, they made
  it so that any implementation that wants to accept both cannot depend on the
  identifier as a way to identify the data type." ~ u/chernobyl169 * /r/btc
