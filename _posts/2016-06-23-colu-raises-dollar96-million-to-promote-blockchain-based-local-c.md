  Tel Aviv-based blockchain startup Colu has raised $9.6m, a fundraising that
  comes amid a shift in its business model that finds it focusing on local
  currency issuance. The Series A round, backed by Aleph, Spark Capital, Digital
  Currency Group and former Thomson Reuters CEO Tom Glocer, follows a $2.5m seed
  round in early 2015 that came at a time when the startup was focused on
  building out its underlying technology.
