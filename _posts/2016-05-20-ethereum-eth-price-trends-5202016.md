description: "The upward Ethereum trend is continuing. Ethereum's price is keeping the structure of its trend, which allows it to grow. Because the upward structure was not disrupted, there is only one option, which is the continuation of the trend. After a rebound, Ethereum's price could not break through the $13.2 support line; thus, the flat was unable to form."
