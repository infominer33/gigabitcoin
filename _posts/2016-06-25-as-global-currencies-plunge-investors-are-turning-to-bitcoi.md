  Global currencies might be plunging in the wake of the historic Brexit vote,
  but it's had a much different effect on Bitcoin. Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency
  that had been plunging in recent days, is soaring on Friday after the Brexit
  vote. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $667.41 per unit, up
  significantly from a Thursday low of $582.92.
