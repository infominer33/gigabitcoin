  Bitcoin right now is not really anonymous. While Bitcoin addresses aren't
  necessarily linked to real-world identities, they can be. And it's possible to
  learn a lot about who's using Bitcoin, and for what, by monitoring the
  unencrypted peer-to-peer network or analysis of the public blockchain, as well
  as through Know Your Customer (KYC) or Anti-Money Laundering (AML)
  regulations.
