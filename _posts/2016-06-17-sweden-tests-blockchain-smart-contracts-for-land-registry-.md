  The government of Sweden is testing a system for registering and recording
  land titles that utilizes blockchain in a bid to digitize real estate
  processes. Lantmäteriet, or the Swedish National Land Survey, revealed today
  that it is working with blockchain startup ChromaWay, consulting firm Kairos
  Future and telephone service provider Telia on a proof-of-concept that
  investigates how blockchain tech could reduce the risk of manual errors while
