  Sia CUDA Miner is a GPU miner designed for mining Siacoins on Nvidia GPUs
  using CUDA instead of OpenCL like on the Siacoin Go pool miner. The Sia CUDA
  Miner is being developed by KlausT ( source) and works pretty well already,
  though it still needs some more work in terms of available features and in
  terms of performance optimizations.
