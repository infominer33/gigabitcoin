  A Washington State utility is raising rates on bitcoin miners, months after a
  dispute with the local industry began over its power usage. The Chelan County
  Public Utility District (PUD) announced earlier this week that, effective
  January 2017, electrical rates will rise for so-called "high-density load
  customers", or those that use 250 kilowatt hours per square foot per year.
