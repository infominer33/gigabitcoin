  Hackers made off with approximately $65 million in bitcoin in an enormous
  security breach of Hong Kong-based exchange, Bitfinex, on Tuesday. The digital
  currency thieves managed to get ahold of a total of 119,756 bitcoin, prompting
  Bitfinex to freeze all customer accounts, which resulted in a 20 percent
  nosedive in the price of bitcoin.
