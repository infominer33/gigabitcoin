  It is not the first money transfers to Bitcoin-related services are blocked by
  financial institutions. However, it is the first time TransferWise is doing
  so, even though they have not been overly kind to Bitcoin so far. Cashila and
  ICONOMI users can no longer receive funds through Transferwise, which is
  rather annoying when making a deposit.
