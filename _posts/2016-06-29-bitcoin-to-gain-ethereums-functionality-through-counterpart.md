  Counterparty is to launch Ethereum's Virtual Machine on testnet in two weeks,
  with a mainnet launch estimated around Autumn 2016, bringing Ethereum's smart
  contract functionality to Bitcoin. Counterparty's EVM is 99% the same as
  Ethereum's, according to sources, and has 85% test coverage, higher than
  Ethereum's python core library, Pyethereum, according to a press release.
