  Launched in September 2015, SearchTrade has already sold 1321 keywords as part
  of its search mining concept. SearchTrade works like any other search engine,
  but takes its revenue from the advertisers, and uses Bitcoin to distribute it
  back to users. In this way, people become active participants with
  technological resources being distributed evenly.
