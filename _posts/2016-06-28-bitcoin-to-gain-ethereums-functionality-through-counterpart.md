      In its relative short history, bitcoin - and its underlying technology the
      blockchain - have captivated thinkers around the world, but not everyone
      was quick to see the potential. Due in part to its initial billing as a
      threat to the traditional financial ecosystem, these institutions have
      perhaps understandably responded with sharp critiques and deep skepticism
      for the technology.

  Counterparty is to launch Ethereum's Virtual Machine on testnet in two weeks,
  with a mainnet launch estimated around Autumn 2016, bringing Ethereum's smart
  contract functionality to Bitcoin. Counterparty's EVM is 99% the same as
  Ethereum's, according to sources, and has 85% test coverage, higher than
  Ethereum's python core library, Pyethereum, according to a press release.
