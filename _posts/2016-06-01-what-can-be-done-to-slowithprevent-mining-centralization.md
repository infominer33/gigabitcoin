description: "Asking how to prevent the mining industry from being centralized into places with low electricity costs is like asking how to prevent the shipping industry from being centralized into cities that are on the coast. Both industries will tend to thrive in places where the profit margins are highest...and there's no profit margin in building a port in a land-locked city."
