  Bitcoin arbitrage is the buying of bitcoins on an exchange where the price is
  very low and selling it at an exchange where the price is relatively higher.
  The prices of Bitcoin vary on various exchanges, due to the fact that the
  markets are not directly linked, and the trading volume, on many exchanges, is
  low enough that the price does not adjust to the average right away.
