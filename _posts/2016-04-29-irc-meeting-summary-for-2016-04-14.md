description: 'Status of 0.12.1: RC2 has been released. Meanwhile there has been a 0.12.1 RC block mined last week. Normally we wait a week after the RC release before labeling it as final, but many like to release it sooner. 0.12.1 features BIP68, BIP112, BIP113 which will be deployed via the BIP9 softfork mechanism.'
