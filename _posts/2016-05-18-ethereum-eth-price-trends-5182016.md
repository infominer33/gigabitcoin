description: "Ethereum's price is moving along a medium-term upward trend. The cancellation of a likely flat has provoked this impulse. The cancellation of a flat wave scenario meant that there is a medium-term trend underway. Because of that, there was no turn to decline and a quite powerful upward trend has played out instead."
