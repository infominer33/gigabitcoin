  Better documentation for the -blockmaxcost option was needed, but it's been
  pointed out it's an awful name as users think the 'max cost' is about the
  monetary cost. Translators also translate it in this way. The term 'block
  cost' is also used in the segwit BIP, sdaftuar proposes to change the
  description in the BIP.
