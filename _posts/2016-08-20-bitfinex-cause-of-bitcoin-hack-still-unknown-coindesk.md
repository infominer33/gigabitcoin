  Nearly two weeks after losing more than $60m in customer funds, Bitfinex
  reports it has not yet identified how the theft was carried out. In a
  statement released earlier today, the exchange reported it had hired Ledger
  Labs, a blockchain consultancy previously contracted by ShapeShift following
  its own cybersecurity problems, to both investigate the theft as well as
  perform a balance sheet audit.
