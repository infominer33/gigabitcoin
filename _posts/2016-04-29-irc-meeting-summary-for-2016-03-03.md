description: "Background: BIP9 is a mechanism for deploying soft forks that replaces the IsSuperMajority() mechanism used to deploy BIPs34, 66, and 65. The older method requires soft forks be rolled out sequentially, as a miner signaling that they're ready to enforce soft fork number 3 must also signal that they're willing to enforce soft forks number 2 and 1."
