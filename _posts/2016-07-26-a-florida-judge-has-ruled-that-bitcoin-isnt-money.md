  Ever since it moved into the mainstream Bitcoin has had a bit of an identity
  crisis. Mainly because no one is really sure whether it should be considered
  money or property. The IRS says it's property for tax purposes, the Commodity
  Futures Trading Commission says it's a commodity, and most Bitcoin advocates
  like to say it's the world's most advanced currency.
