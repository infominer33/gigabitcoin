  For Bitcoin, the Brexit poll couldn't have come at a more uneasy time but some
  good developments are taking place on the sideline. The digital currency has
  been in and out of an almost three-week low on Thursday June 23 at around the
  $580 range which is quite worrying especially for those who still cringe in
  anticipation of a smooth ride as they step into its world.
