  Blockchain analytics startup Elliptic has integrated with LexisNexis, a move
  that provides the startup's clients with access to the vendor's global money
  laundering database. The hope, the companies say, is to provide financial
  services firms with data on bitcoins transactions so that they can avoid
  interacting with parties tied to money laundering or other perceived to
  illicit activities.
