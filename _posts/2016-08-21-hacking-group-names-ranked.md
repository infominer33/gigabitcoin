  This week, a big hacking story broke. Hackers going under the name "The Shadow
  Brokers" claimed to have hacked a group linked to the NSA referred to as
  "Equation Group." The hackers dumped a bunch of the group's hacking tools and
  started a (so far not very successful) bitcoin auction to release more files.
