  Martin Tillier, a financial advisor who writes for Nasdaq, says the recent DAO
  hack shows there is a vulnerability in Ethereum and that while some might have
  thought it would reflect negatively on bitcoin, bitcoin's price activity
  demonstrates the reverse. While bitcoin does not offer the development
  capabilities of Ethereum, it has demonstrated better reliability.
