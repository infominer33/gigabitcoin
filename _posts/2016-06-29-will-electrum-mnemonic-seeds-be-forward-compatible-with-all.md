  In fact, the reason Electrum 2.x changed to a 13-word seed* and is
  incompatible with BIP39 is because they added a version number to the end of
  the seed. This has the purpose of allowing future versions of Electrum update
  the seed format while still understanding how to derive all the addresses from
  previous seed versions.
