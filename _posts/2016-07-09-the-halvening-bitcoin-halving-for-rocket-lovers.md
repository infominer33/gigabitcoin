  In the Bitcoin network, user transactions are grouped in blocks and recorded
  to a digital public ledger called a blockchain. Miners are in charge of this
  task, and receive a mining reward in the form of bitcoins for each block
  recorded. The amount of bitcoins rewarded for each block decreases with time:
  it is halved every 4 years.
