  A new resolution submitted to the US House of Representatives calls for the
  development of "a national policy for technology" that would include digital
  currencies and blockchain technology. It invokes the idea of bitcoin without
  calling it by name - referring to "alternative non-fiat currencies" - and
  blockchain tech, which it says has the potential to "fundamentally change" how
  trust and security are established in online transactions.
