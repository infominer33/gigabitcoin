  so-called "crypto-currencies" - digital equivalents of a monetary exchange
  unit, have been all the rage. The most well-known in the category, Bitcoin,
  has had quite a run. Starting out as a "virtual penny stock" it rose in 2014
  to the elevated height of $1,150, before crashing back to earth.
