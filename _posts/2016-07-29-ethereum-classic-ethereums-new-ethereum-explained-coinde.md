      Peter Randall, one of the founders and former CEO of the alternative
      European stock exchange Chi-X, and Anthony Culligan, founder of
      peer-to-peer bitcoin trading venue Roolo, have announced to launch
      blockchain startup SETL. SETL will introduce a permissioned blockchain

  What started as an attempt to rescue investor funds in a high-profile project
  has resulted in a schism that has effectively split the community on the
  second-largest public blockchain. The split is not only psychological. Thanks
  to the design of public blockchain systems, it is also technical, with
  competing visions manifesting in two very real blockchains, or versions of the
  project's transaction history.
