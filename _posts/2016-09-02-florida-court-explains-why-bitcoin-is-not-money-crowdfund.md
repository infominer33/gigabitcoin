  Having just gotten around to reading the order granting the motion to dismiss
  in the proceedings of the State of Florida vs. Michell Abner Espinoza, the
  document by Circuit Court Judge Teresa Pooler, is pretty interesting. The case
  regarding Espinoza has been in the news for many months now, but the final
  ruling was just filed in July.
