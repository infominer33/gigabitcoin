  Coil whine: it's not just a problem for PC gaming enthusiasts anymore. A
  recent paper outlines an attack vector for capturing RSA keys by analyzing the
  noises, RF variations, or electromagnetic changes produced from computers as
  they do intense computational tasks. Of particular note is their work
  capturing RSA keys with sound.
