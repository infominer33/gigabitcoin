  Here's a look at what we are focusing on in the bitcoin price this morning.
  It's taken us a little longer than expected, but we've finally got some decent
  momentum in the bitcoin price. In yesterday's analysis we highlighted the fact
  that - despite the fundamentals suggesting we might see some action - price
  had stayed relatively flat across the last week or so.
