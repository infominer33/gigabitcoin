  For years, Tian Jia made the kind of returns on his money that investors in
  the rest of the world could only dream of. The 29-year-old Beijing-based
  programmer had $440,000 on deposit at the Hong Kong bitcoin exchange Bitfinex
  until last week and, on good days, would wake up to find a couple thousand
  more dollars in his account than when he went to sleep.
