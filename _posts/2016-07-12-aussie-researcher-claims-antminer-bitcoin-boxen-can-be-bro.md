  Australian security researcher Tim Noise says scores of popular Antmine
  Bitcoin mining devices could be commandeered. Noise demonstrated how a
  vulnerability in the configuration of the open source mining program CGminer
  running on an Antminer box can be abused to redirect the efforts of massive
  mining operations to fill an attacker's wallet.
