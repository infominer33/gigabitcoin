      A new service is offering bitcoin users an answer to the common question:
      what is the optimum transaction fee? Using network data from the past
      three hours, CoinTape lets users compare the current waiting times
      associated with various fee tiers, calculated in satoshis per byte. It
      claims to predict delays with 90% confidence.

  Lately, there have been issues with unconfirmed transactions in the Bitcoin
  world. One experience I had dealing with this problem was on February 29th as
  I waited three days for a large sum transaction to confirm. This is the
  longest I've had to wait for confirmation.
