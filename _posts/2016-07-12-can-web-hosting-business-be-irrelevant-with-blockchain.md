  Should you wish to own a gun, you apply for a licence and have a background
  check, the police then inspect your property to see that you are storing it
  safely and the ammunition is kept away from the weapon. Unless you are a
  farmer or a sportsman, owning a gun is seen as largely a waste of money.
