  Here comes a new ccMiner 1.7.6-r5 fork from Nanashi Meiyo-Meijin ( source)
  based on tpruvot's fork of ccMiner, but with even faster Lyra2REv2
  performance. The ccMiner 1.5.80-git SP Nicehash fork from yesterday with
  improved Lyra2REv2 hashrate was apparently based on the code from the same
  author, but the Windows binary we have compiled from the ccMiner 1.7.6-r5
  source seems to be slightly more optimized and thus is a bit faster.
