  I was in a marine cruise in Walvis Bay, Namibia, watching dolphins, seals,
  mola molas, cormorants, not paying so much attention in taking pictures. But
  then, the captain threw a piece of fish from the boat and I had the privilege
  of picturing a pelican at the exact moment he grabbed the bite.
