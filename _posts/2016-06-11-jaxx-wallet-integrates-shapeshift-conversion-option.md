  The Jaxx wallet solution continues to take the cryptocurrency world by storm.
  Not only has the wallet added support for The DAO tokens, but the team also
  interacted ShapeShift. This will allow users to convert between all three
  wallet-supported currencies within the app itself. Adding more functionality
  to a cryptocurrency wallet is always a positive thing.
