      In its relative short history, bitcoin - and its underlying technology the
      blockchain - have captivated thinkers around the world, but not everyone

  money is considered high risk, in part due to its volatility, Peter Smith,
  chief executive of Blockchain, a bitcoin wallet, said the cryptocurrency was a
  better bet than regular currencies.
