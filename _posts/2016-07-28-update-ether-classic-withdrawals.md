  Continuing from our previous announcement about some of the implications of
  the Ethereum "Hard Fork," we at Gemini would like to provide an update on our
  ongoing plans to address developing interest in ETC (Ether Classic or ETHC).
  At the moment, Gemini offers trading and withdrawals of ether only on the
  "Hard Fork" ETH branch and not on the ETC branch.
