  Interesting news this week as Belgium-based Optima Bank has been shut down by
  both the National Bank of Belgium (which also acts as the Belgian regulating
  body) as well as the ECB. According to the national supervisor, the bank would
  have been unable to meet its commitments to its clients and was forced to
  cease all banking activities after some potentially fraudulent transaction
  were unveiled.
