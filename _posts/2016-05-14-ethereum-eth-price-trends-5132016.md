description: "Ethereum continues its upward trend. The structure of the trend was not disrupted at a key level, which resulted in a new upward impulse. After a rebound from a medium-term level, Ethereum's price has continued its upward movement. The power of that impulse is caused by the inablity of the market to form a turn to decline."

<article style=""><h1>Ethereum (ETH) Price Trends: 5/13/2016</h1><p>Ethereum continues its upward trend. The structure of the trend was not disrupted at a key level, which resulted in a new upward impulse. After a rebound from a medium-term level, Ethereum's price has continued its upward movement. The power of that impulse is caused by the inablity of the market to form a turn to decline.</p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tR-_883XQSf8rI0noPiuTwl9vj9y9yYXxY3P6PuKIg6hDa7sG1R28FICYDM_CvKtFahT020Ajcc_Jlf-AsFADLvuqoSMVt3E-zrY96tEqWxuln2TcRoNC0NNNmQuX5mXoEMZ0HId" /></article>
