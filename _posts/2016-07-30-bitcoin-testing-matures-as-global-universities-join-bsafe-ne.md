  A group of researchers are encouraging universities to set up bitcoin nodes as
  part of an effort to allow students and professors to experiment and test the
  network. The private testbed network, called BSafe, aims to help the
  technology proliferate, while possibly preventing instances such as the
  collapse of Mt Gox or The DAO from happening in the future.
