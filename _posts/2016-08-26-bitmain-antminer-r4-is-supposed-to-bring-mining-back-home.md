  Bitmain is apparently setting a very ambitious goal of their new miner called
  AntMiner R4 and that goal is to bring back home mining of Bitcoin. What they
  are doing in order to get home miners' attention is trying to make the miner
  more compact and less noisy while still managing to provide quite a serious
  hashrate rated at 8.6 THS with just about 845 W of power usage.
