  feature that allows users to make peer-to-peer payments on Twitter. iPayYou is
  claimed to be the first bitcoin wallet that enables Twitter's 310 million
  monthly users to make peer-to-peer payments over Twitter with payments being
  made by simply entering a recipient's Twitter account name instead of an email
  of bitcoin.
