  Originally conceived in October 2013 by founder and project leader David
  Vorick, the decentralized cloud storage program Sia received some backing from
  a crowdfund in early 2014. The network was launched for private beta testing
  around twelve months ago, for developers and those who weren't afraid to use
  the command line interface.
