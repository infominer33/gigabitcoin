  After reaching a low of $550 during the week, the bitcoin price rose again
  reaching a high of $650 today. Although it was normal to see a correction
  after the fast climb of the previous weeks, the bitcoin price probably fell
  also because of the " Bremain ", or the possibility of UK to remain into the
  EU.
