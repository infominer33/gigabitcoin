  Bitcoin micropayments startup SatoshiPay is developing a new proof-of-concept
  with Visa Europe's innovation unit. Work on the project was first disclosed
  earlier this year, when Visa Europe Collab said that it was exploring bitcoin
  micropayments for connected devices. At the time, the company indicated it was
  looking at use cases like smart light bulbs that could pay for their own
  electricity.
