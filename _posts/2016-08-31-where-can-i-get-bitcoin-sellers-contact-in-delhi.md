  I'd like an infinite computer to play with. It should have unlimited memory
  and be able to do infinitely many computations in a finite amount of time.
  (For that second condition, it could do one computation in a microsecond, the
  next in half a microsecond, the third in 1/4 microsecond, etc.)
