  Today the Bitfury Group released a white paper about Flare, a hybrid routing
  algorithm for payment routing on the Lightning Network. The paper suggests a
  two-phase algorithm: (1) a proactive update of the node's routing map, which
  stores information about network topology, along with (2) reactive collection
  of information as needed when required by a Lightning Network request.
