  Bitcoin and ether prices rode a rollercoaster during the week ending 24th
  June, plunging lower at some points and pushing higher at others as market
  participants responded to global economic uncertainty. The price of bitcoin
  approached $800, the looming 'Brexit' vote, the latest developments
  surrounding the collapse of The DAO and a trading outage at exchange Bitfinex
  all helped fuel these sharp price fluctuations.
