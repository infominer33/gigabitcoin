      A message from Josh Tyrangiel -Josh Tyrangiel You are an educated,
      successful person capable of abstract thought. A VP doing an SVP's job.
      Your office, appointed with decent furniture and a healthy amount of
      natural light filtered through vertical blinds, is commensurate with
      nearly two decades of service to the craft of management.

  Designing expressive distributed protocols that can gracefully withstand
  attacks and manipulation is not a trivial task. Even solving a relatively
  simple use case, Bitcoin's success in providing currency free of central
  control was certainly cause for celebration. When dealing with more complex
  problems, like financial contracts and governance, we have to step up our
  game.
