      On 26 May, CNN broadcast an unusual clip of a US navy intelligence flight
      over the South China Sea. The P-8A Poseidon surveillance plane - one of
      the newest weapons in the Pentagon's arsenal - had taken off, with a CNN
      reporter on board, from Clark airbase in the Philippines, once part of
      America's largest overseas base complex during the cold war.
