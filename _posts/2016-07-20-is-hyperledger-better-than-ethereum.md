  I actually did find a random kitty dying on the middle of the road on my way
  back from school once. I found its sibling dead(it had been crushed by a
  passing car) and this kitty was just sitting in the middle of the road...it
  had not opened its eyes yet..it kept squealing in a high pitched voice.
