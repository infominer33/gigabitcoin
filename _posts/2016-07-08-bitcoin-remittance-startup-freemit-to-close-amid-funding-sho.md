  Bitcoin remittance startup Freemit is officially closing its doors, two years
  after it first began an effort to build a remittance service. CEO John Biggs,
  a former editor for TechCrunch, said that the decision to shutter the
  operation came after a "perfect storm" of a lack of a viable product to show
  investors and, consequently, the inability to raise funds.
