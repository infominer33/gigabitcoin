  Most food in Rome during the classical period was take-away, fast food,
  prepared in street stalls. The vast majority of Romans lived in apartments
  that had no kitchens -- mostly for fire-safety reasons. They had to buy their
  meals and either eat them on the street (very popular) or bring them home for
  later consumption.
