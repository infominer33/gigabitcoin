  iPayYou, the Bitcoin wallet created by former top Amazon executive Gene
  Kavner, launched a new Pay-by-Twitter feature. Users are now able to send a
  payment by entering the payee's Twitter handle instead of an email or bitcoin
  address, so transactions can be completed without exchanging private
  information.
