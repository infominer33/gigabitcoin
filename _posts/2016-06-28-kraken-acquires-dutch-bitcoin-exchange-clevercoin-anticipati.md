  Kraken, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in Europe, has acquired Dutch
  Bitcoin exchange CleverCoin, further consolidating its dominance in the
  region, and also anticipating increased demand amid Brexit-induced
  uncertainty. It is the third digital currency exchange Kraken has swallowed
  this year; less than six months ago it acquired both Coinsetter and Cavirtex.
