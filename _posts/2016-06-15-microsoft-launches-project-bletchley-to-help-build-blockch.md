  Microsoft today unveiled a new project designed to make it easier for
  businesses across a wide range of industries to build consortiums that better
  take advantage of blockchain technology. Since a distributed ledger technology
  like the blockchain is only as powerful as the number people or companies that
  use them, Microsoft intends this new suite of tools to help build those
  networks.
