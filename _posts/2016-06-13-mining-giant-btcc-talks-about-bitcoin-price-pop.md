      A bitcoin entrepreneur and a trading veteran have partnered on a
      blockchain project that aims to streamline the way assets are exchanged.
      SETL will use its blockchain, which is "akin to proof-of-stake", to let
      market participants cut out the web of intermediaries in the post-trade
      system, saving them time and money.

  The fact that Bitcoin is undervalued is probably not news to many people
  involved in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Bitcoin's recent price increase,
  through the $500 resistance point, rallied over the weekend and is now about
  to cross $700 (£493, €621). The most immediate price driver is the halving of
  the number of Bitcoins being mined.
