  The price of bitcoin has benefitted from macroeconomic uncertainty this year,
  rising more than 50% over the last six months as China devalued the yuan and
  the UK dramatically exited the European Union. As the calendar rolls ahead to
  August, and excitement over these price drivers fades, market observers are
  beginning to wonder if further global events will benefit the digital
  currency's markets in 2016.
