  The technical setups posted below use simple trend detection, support and
  resistance, channels, pattern and candle analysis. We aim for high-probability
  trade setups on BTCUSD and use very few indicators. All charts use BNC's
  Bitcoin Liquid Index for maximum accuracy. The timeframe for trades is 1 to 7
  days, so we'll use 4h candlesticks.
