  As Bitfinex, the digital-currency exchange that suffered a debilitating hack
  this week, tries to determine if it can go on, a wider question is again being
  asked about bitcoin: Is it really a better mousetrap? On Tuesday, Hong
  Kong-based Bitfinex was the victim of a hack that led to the theft of about
  200,000 bitcoins worth $65 million from its digital vaults.
