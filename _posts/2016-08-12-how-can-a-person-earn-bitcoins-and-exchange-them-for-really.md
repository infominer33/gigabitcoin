  I'm surprised Donald Trump hasn't accused NASA of rigging astronomical orbits
  to disadvantage him. I haven't grown up hyper-wealthy. I haven't had
  arm-twisting, powerful contacts in my pocket my whole life, to coerce others
  into doing what I want them to do, whether it's bad for them or not.
