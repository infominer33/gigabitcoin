      In its relative short history, bitcoin - and its underlying technology the
      blockchain - have captivated thinkers around the world, but not everyone
      was quick to see the potential. Due in part to its initial billing as a
      threat to the traditional financial ecosystem, these institutions have
      perhaps understandably responded with sharp critiques and deep skepticism
      for the technology.

  Bitcoin infrastructure architect Blockstream has acquired wallet provider
  GreenAddress in a move the startup says could impact the development of its
  signature, still in-development sidechains solution. Following the
  acquisition, GreenAddress Wallet's team of three developers will continue to
  work on privacy and security bolstering features for the wallet as well as
  compatibility for sidechains, a bitcoin infrastructure component that
  Blockstream has raised $76m in two investment rounds to engineer.
