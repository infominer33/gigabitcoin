  Cryptocurrency enthusiasts would like nothing more than seeing major retailers
  accept Bitcoin payments directly. Albeit there is no additional hardware cost
  for brands to do so, they will need to train staff members to complete
  transactions. A new petition has surfaced on Change.org to have Walmart accept
  Bitcoin payments moving forward.
