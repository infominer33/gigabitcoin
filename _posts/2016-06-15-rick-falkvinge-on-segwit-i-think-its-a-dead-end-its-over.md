  Rick Falkvinge on Segwit: I think it's a dead-end. It's over-engineering.
  Proponents of Segwit have tried to sell it as a scaling solution and/or a fix
  for malleability. If you're trying to solve scaling, it's a horrible solution.
  Segwit is extremely over-engineered to fix malleability/scalability. * /r/btc
