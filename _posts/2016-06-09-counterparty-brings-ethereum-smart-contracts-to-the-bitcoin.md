      In its relative short history, bitcoin - and its underlying technology the
      blockchain - have captivated thinkers around the world, but not everyone
      was quick to see the potential. Due in part to its initial billing as a
      threat to the traditional financial ecosystem, these institutions have
      perhaps understandably responded with sharp critiques and deep skepticism
      for the technology.

  Counterparty, the technology for decentralized financial tools on the Bitcoin
  blockchain, has started running Ethereum smart contracts by porting the
  Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to its codebase. In late 2014, Counterparty
  added their support to execute the Ethereum smart contracts platform on
  Bitcoin; however, at that time, Ethereum was in its pre-alpha stage of
  development, with its first major release, Frontier, not yet being announced.
