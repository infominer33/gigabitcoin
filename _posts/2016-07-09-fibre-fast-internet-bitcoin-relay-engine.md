  Because TCP is designed to provide reliable transmission at reasonable
  bandwidth across medium-large amounts of data, it is incredibly bad at
  low-latency relay of small amounts of data. It is generally tuned to send
  packets (each just under 1500 bytes) once and to only discover that some
  packets were lost after getting a response from the other side.
