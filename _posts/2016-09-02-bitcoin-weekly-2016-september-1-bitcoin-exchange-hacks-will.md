  exchanges suffered a hack and that almost half of all exchanges during the
  period closed? Not too surprising, given that Bitcoin is still an emerging and
  developing market, but this statistic from a report out of the University of
  Tulsa's Tandy School of Computer Science shines a light on the current
  security (or insecurity) facing Bitcoin exchanges right now.
