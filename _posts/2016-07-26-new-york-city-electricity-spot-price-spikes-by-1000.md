  By the look of things, Washington is not the only area where electricity
  prices are on the rise. New York City saw a 1,000% electricity price spike due
  to a lasting heatwave after a thunderstorm. This is not good news for anyone
  who is mining Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency in this city, as their
  electricity bill will go up significantly.
