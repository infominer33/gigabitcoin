  The concept of Silk Road has been quite appealing to various people throughout
  the years. After the original Silk Road marketplace had been shut down,
  version 2.0 arrived on the scene not much later. But law enforcement managed
  to close down that platform as well, and the second-in-command was sentenced
  to eight years in prison yesterday.
