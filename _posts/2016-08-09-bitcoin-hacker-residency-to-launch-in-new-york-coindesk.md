  A bitcoin development training program will launch in New York City this
  September to teach new developers the basics of the protocol. While bitcoin
  might not be the easiest software to master today, bitcoin R&D group Chaincode
  Labs believes it can help mitigate this issue by giving developers an option
  to learn in an environment that is more supportive and interactive than
  current online materials can offer.
