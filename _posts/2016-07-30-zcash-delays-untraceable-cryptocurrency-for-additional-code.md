  The launch of the genesis block for a new cryptocurrency designed to make real
  the anonymity once thought to be offered by bitcoin has been delayed once
  again. Zooko Wilcox, early cypherpunk and founder of anonymous cryptocurrency
  startup Zcash, told CoinDesk yesterday that his startup will likely be pushing
  back the mining of its blockchain in order to give multiple third-party
  auditors the time to perform an in-depth code analysis.
