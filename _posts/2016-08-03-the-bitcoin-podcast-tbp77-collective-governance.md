  Our guest today is Greg Slepak, Software developer of Espionage 3 &amp;
  founder of the okTurtles Foundation, who talked about the bitcoin block size
  debate as surfacing "politics" in the bitcoin ecosystem. The politics are
  intense, there are ways that bitcoin governance is like government, and
  proposals to fork the software are kind of like constitutional amendments.
