      A new VoIP service allows you to hide who you are by being web-based,
      having no registration checks, allowing you to spoof caller identity, and
      pay by Bitcoin. Bitphone calls itself the Bitcoin Payphone. As well as
      taking Bitcoin, the service accepts more than forty other altcoins.
