  The state assemblyman behind efforts to regulate digital currency businesses
  in California cited the $65m hack of Bitfinex this week as evidence of the
  need for tighter industry controls. In a statement issued following his
  state's decision to temporarily shelve new rulemakings this year, he said that
  more time was needed to strike a balance between giving virtual currency
  businesses a firm foundation and ensuring consumers are protected.
