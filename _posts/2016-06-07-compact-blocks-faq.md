  Compact block relay, BIP152, is a method of reducing the amount of bandwidth
  used to propagate new blocks to full nodes. Using simple techniques it is
  possible to reduce the amount of bandwidth necessary to propagate new blocks
  to full nodes when they already share much of the same mempool contents.
