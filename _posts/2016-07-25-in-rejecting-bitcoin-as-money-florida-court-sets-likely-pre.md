  A Miami judge has dismissed charges against a Florida-based bitcoin seller
  after he was indicted in 2014 on illegal money transmission and money
  laundering charges. Judge Teresa Mary Pooler sided with the defense's argument
  that bitcoin doesn't constitute a form of money within the confines of
  Florida's legal system, stating in a ruling issued today that Michell Espinoza
  doesn't qualify as a money transmitter as argued by the prosecution.
