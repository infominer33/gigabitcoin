  The first Siacoin (SC) mining pool with Stratum support by Suprnova is now
  available in beta and you are welcome to give it a try and report your
  experience with it. In theory the stratum support should result in further
  reducing the stale shares and improving efficiency, so if everything works
  fine you should be able to mine more coins for the same time.
