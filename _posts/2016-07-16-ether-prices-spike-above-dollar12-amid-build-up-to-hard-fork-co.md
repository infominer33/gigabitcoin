  Ether, the native digital currency of ethereum, saw sharp gains while bitcoin
  experienced comparatively mild price fluctuations following last week's
  halving. The price of ether pushed higher during the seven days through 14th
  July as the broader ethereum community came closer to implementing a hard fork
  that would offer a solution to funds compromised during the demise of the
  distributed autonomous organization, The DAO.
