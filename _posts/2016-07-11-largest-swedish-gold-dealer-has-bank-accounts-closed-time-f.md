  Last month, Sweden's largest precious metal dealer posted a notice that their
  bank account had been closed without their consent. Tavex Guld & Valuta posted
  a notice on June 30th that their bank account had been unilaterally closed.
  This left the dealer without an efficient way of accepting payments for good,
  racing to establish a new payment system.
