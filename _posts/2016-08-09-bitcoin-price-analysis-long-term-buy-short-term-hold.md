  The technical setups posted below use simple trend detection, support and
  resistance, channels, pattern and candlestick analysis. We aim for
  high-probability trade setups on BTCUSD and use very few indicators. All
  charts use BNC's Bitcoin Liquid Index for maximum accuracy. The timeframe for
  trades is 1 to 7 days, so we'll use 4h candlesticks.
