  Yes. She's socially left-wing, economically moderate, and tough as nails in
  foreign policy. She's also the the only person who has ever run for President
  who might actually be overqualified for the position. She has no scandals in
  her past and no skeletons in her closet - despite three decades worth of
  effort and countless tax dollars wasted to find them.
