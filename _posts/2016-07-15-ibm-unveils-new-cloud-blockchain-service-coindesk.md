  IBM today unveiled a new service designed to help regulated businesses test
  and run blockchain projects meant to handle private or sensitive business
  data. Dubbed the IBM 'secure blockchain cloud environment', the service is
  actually an integration of IBM's existing blockchain cloud offering and IBM
  LinuxONE, a Linux server designed to protect against 'back doors' the company
  argues could occur in other cloud-based blockchain networks by securing entry
  points and fighting against insider threats.
