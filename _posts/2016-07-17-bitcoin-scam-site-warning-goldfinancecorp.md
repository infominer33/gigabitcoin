  Any company offering an hourly return to investors should never be trusted. It
  is just impossible to provide a guaranteed hourly restitution of any
  investment to a user unless their deposit is not being spent at all. Moreover,
  if no funds come in from other investors, the question becomes how companies
  such as GoldFinanceCorp can even hope to survive.
