  Blockchain is a shared public ledger underlying the Bitcoin network. It chains
  transactions together in blocks which are then encrypted. This makes these
  transactions extremely difficult for hackers to access the information. It
  also creates a permanent record of all payments as blockchains exist forever
  and can't be removed.
