      1. Fundraising is a filtering exercise, not a popularity contest. I could
      tell within 5 minutes of meeting an investor whether they would invest.
      Investors who invested were excited about eShares before we met. They
      either saw the vision and liked it. Or they didn't. Most didn't but met me
      anyway.

  The inability to access funds and a sudden change of contract terms and
  conditions without notice has thrown investors within the online trading
  company, OneFxZone into panic mode. Originally known as OneFxZone, 'One
