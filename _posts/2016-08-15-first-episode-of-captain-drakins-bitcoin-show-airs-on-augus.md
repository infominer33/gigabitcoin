  Putting Bitcoin on the big screen is not an easy feat. Albeit there are plenty
  of Bitcoin documentaries in the world, they only seem to gain traction within
  the community itself. Bitfilm has created a new initiative, called Captain
  Drakin's Bitcoin show. This animated series will inform people about Bitcoin
  and cryptocurrency.
