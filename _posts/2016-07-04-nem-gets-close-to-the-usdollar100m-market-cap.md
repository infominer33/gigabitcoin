  New Economy Movement is one of the cryptocurrencies very few people have paid
  attention to in the past. Many enthusiasts assumed this was just another
  altcoin, even though it uses a completely different codebase. But over the
  past few months, NEM - or XEM, as it is called on the exchanges - has been
  increasing in value.
