description: 'Since SIAcoin started trading on Poloniex in September, 2015, the range between 38-40 Satoshi has acted as resistance about five times. On May 19th, the market finally broke above this big resistance range. It is recommended for every trader to be aware of the technical significance of this price range, as this area may act as a support buffer at some point in the future.'
