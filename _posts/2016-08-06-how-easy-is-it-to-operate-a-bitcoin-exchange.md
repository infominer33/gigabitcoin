  I've seen this question around Quora for a long time, internally debating
  whether I should answer it. Well, here's my answer. I went to my pediatrician
  for a regular check-up when I was 13. Instead, I was assigned to their
  physician's assistant (PA), which was fine- she seemed nice and professional.
