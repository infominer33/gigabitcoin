  The Omni Layer Foundation recently released the latest version of its
  Decentralized Exchange, OmniDex 2.0. Omni holders will soon start receiving
  0.05% of the exchange volume as interest, after an introductory month of fee
  free trading. The project initially launched as Mastercoin in 2013, raising
  over 5000 bitcoins in industry's first crowdfund, about $500,000 at the time.
