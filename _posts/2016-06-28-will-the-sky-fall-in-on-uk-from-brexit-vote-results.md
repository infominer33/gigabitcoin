  The people of the United Kingdom have historically voted to leave the European
  Union making it the first state in the block to do so. I believe the vote to
  leave was more about getting out from under the dictatorship of the unelected
  bureaucrats in Brussels who are lording their laws across the continent with
  little regard for its citizens than a separation from the countries of Europe
  themselves.
