  Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide,
  decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars,
  bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever:
  there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is
  more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks.

  I recently put most of my trading funds in Bitfinex because with BitGo and
  per-customer wallets my deposits were insured up to $250k. Now Bitgo has
  removed all information on insurance. WTF?! * /r/Bitcoin
