  One evening in April, Dave Winston stood in a convenience store in suburban
  Charlotte, N.C., uneasily shoving $20 bills into a slim automated-teller
  machine unlike any he had ever seen. He was buying bitcoin, a digital currency
  unknown to him a few hours earlier, before hackers took over his computer.
