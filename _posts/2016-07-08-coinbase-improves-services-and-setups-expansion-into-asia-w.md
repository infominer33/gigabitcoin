  San Francisco-based bitcoin and digital asset exchange Coinbase recently
  announced a strategic partnership with Japan's largest commercial bank, the
  Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (BTMU), to "support Coinbase's long-term
  international expansion efforts." Japan has been a rapidly growing market for
  bitcoin this year, with Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange BitFlyer skyrocketing up
  to the number three exchange by volume, and both Quoine and BTCBOX regularly
  reaching the top ten.
