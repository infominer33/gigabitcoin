  US law firm Steptoe & Johnson LLP has filed a petition with the Commodity
  Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), calling on the agency to provide more
  clarity regarding the definition of "delivery" in blockchain-based
  transactions. Signed by Steptoe partner Micah Green and senior policy advisor
  (and former CFTC commissioner) Michael Dunn, the petition centers around
  actions the agency took against Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange Bitfinex in
  June.
