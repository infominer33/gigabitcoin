  One of the main themes of this year's Embedded Linux Conference and OpenIoT
  Summit was the challenge of bridging the growing number of Internet of Things
  (IoT) standards. Many speakers were hopeful about the potential for achieving
  functional interoperability, if not a unifying standard, and there were even
  calls for a possible merger between two of the largest open source efforts:
  AllSeen and IoTivity.
