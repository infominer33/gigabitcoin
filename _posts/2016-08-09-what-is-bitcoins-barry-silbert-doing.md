  I continue to believe strongly, and publicly state whenever convenient to do
  so, that Barry Silbert's "Ethereum Classic" scam is, well, a scam. I try to
  honor as many different beliefs and views as humanly possible - that's part of
  what being a researcher, journalist, and investor entails in the 21st century.
