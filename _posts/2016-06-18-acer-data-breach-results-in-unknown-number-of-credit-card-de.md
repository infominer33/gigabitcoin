      There is a direct correlation between how quickly an organization can
      identify and contain a data breach and the financial consequences that may
      result. If your organization experienced a data breach, would you be
      prepared? In this situation you need to act quickly to not only meet
      various compliance regulations, but also to limit the scope of the damage
      caused by the breach.

  information has been stolen. Although very specific details are still wrapped
  in mystery for the time being; it looks like credit card details were part of
