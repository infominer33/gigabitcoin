  Scalability is one of the main challenges faced by distributed ledger
  technology. It is widely felt that in order to challenge traditional payment
  networks and assume a key role in the decentralized future of the internet,
  blockchains must find ways to radically improve their throughput, measured in
  number of transactions per second.
