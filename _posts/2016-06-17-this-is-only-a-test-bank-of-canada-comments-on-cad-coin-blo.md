  Canada's central bank unveiled a blockchain-based interbank payment experiment
  earlier this week, a move the institution said in new statements isn't
  intended to launch a new e-money system. When reached for comment, Central
  Bank of Canada senior deputy governor Carolyn Wilkins said that the 'CAD-coin'
